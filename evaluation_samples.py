"for each batch in the stream. That is, where the higher level functions such as `map` transform a DStream to another DStream, `transform` allows us to apply functions from an RDD to another RDD. For example, we can use the RDD `join` operator to join each batch of the stream to an existing RDD that we computed separately from our streaming application (perhaps, in Spark or some other system).\n\n### Note\n\nThe full list of transformations and further information on each of them is provided in the Spark documentation at <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#transformations-on-dstreams>.\n\n### Actions\n\nWhile some of the operators we have seen in Spark Streaming, such as `count`, are not actions as in the batch RDD case, Spark Streaming has the concept of **actions** on DStreams. Actions are **output** operators that, when invoked, trigger computation on the DStream. They are as follows:\n\n  * `print`: This prints the first 10 elements of each batch to the console and is typically used for debugging and testing.\n  * `saveAsObjectFile`, `saveAsTextFiles`, and `saveAsHadoopFiles`: These functions output each batch to a Hadoop-compatible filesystem with a filename (if applicable) derived from the batch start timestamp.\n  * `forEachRDD`: This operator is the most generic and allows us to apply any arbitrary processing to the RDDs within each batch of a DStream. It is used to apply _side effects_ , such as saving data to an external system, printing it for testing, exporting it to a dashboard, and so on.\n\n### Tip\n\nNote that like batch processing with Spark, DStream operators are **lazy**. In the same way in which we need to call an action, such as `count`, on an RDD to ensure that processing takes place, we need to call one of the preceding action operators in order to trigger computation on a DStream. Otherwise, our streaming application will not actually perform any computation.\n\n### Window operators\n\nAs Spark Streaming operates on time-ordered batched streams of data, it introduces a new concept, which is that of **windowing**. A `window` function computes a transformation over a sliding window applied to the stream.\n\nA window is defined by the length of the window and the sliding interval. For example, with a 10-second window and a 5-second sliding interval, we will compute results every 5 seconds, based on the latest 10 seconds of data in the DStream. For example, we might wish to calculate the top websites by page view numbers over the last 10 seconds and recompute this metric every 5 seconds using a sliding window.\n\nThe following figure illustrates a windowed DStream:\n\nA windowed DStream\n\n## Caching and fault tolerance with Spark Streaming\n\nLike Spark RDDs, DStreams can be cached in memory. The use cases for caching are similar to those for RDDs--if we expect to access the data in a DStream multiple times (perhaps performing multiple types of analysis or aggregation or outputting to multiple external systems), we will benefit from caching the data. Stateful operators, which include `window` functions and `updateStateByKey`, do this automatically for efficiency.\n\nRecall that RDDs are immutable datasets and are defined by their input data source and **lineage** --that is, the set of transformations and actions that are applied to the RDD. Fault tolerance in RDDs works by recreating the RDD (or partition of an RDD) that is lost due to the failure of a worker node.\n\nAs DStreams are themselves batches of RDDs, they can also be recomputed as required to deal with worker node failure. However, this depends on the input data still being available. If the data source itself is fault-tolerant and persistent (such as HDFS or some other fault-tolerant data store), then the DStream can be recomputed.\n\nIf data stream sources are delivered over a network (which is a common case with stream processing), Spark Streaming's default persistence behavior is to replicate data to two worker nodes. This allows network DStreams to be recomputed in the case of failure. Note, however, that any data received by a node but _not yet replicated_ might be lost when a node fails.\n\nSpark Streaming also supports recovery of the driver node in the event of failure. However, currently, for network-based sources, data in the memory of worker nodes will be lost in this case. Hence, Spark Streaming is not fully fault-tolerant in the face of failure of the driver node or application.\n\n### Note\n\nSee http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#caching--persistence and <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#fault-tolerance-properties> for more details.\n\n# Creating a Spark Streaming application\n\nWe will now work through creating our first Spark Streaming application to illustrate some of the basic concepts around Spark Streaming that we introduced earlier.\n\nWe will expand on the example applications used in Chapter 1, _Getting Up and Running with Spark_ , where we used a small example dataset of product purchase events. For this example, instead of using a static set of data, we will create a simple producer application that will randomly generate events and send them over a network connection. We will then create a few Spark Streaming consumer applications that will process this event stream.\n\nThe sample project for this chapter contains the code you will need. It is called `scala-spark-streaming-app`. It consists of a Scala SBT project definition file, the example application source code, and a `\\src\\main\\resources` directory that contains a file called `names.csv`.\n\nThe `build.sbt` file for the project contains the following project definition", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"id": "3", "content": "385965**\n    **...**\n\nSince both models start with the same initial weight vector, we see that they both make the same predictions on this first batch and, therefore, have the same error.\n\nIf we leave the streaming program running for a few minutes, we should eventually see that one of the models has started converging, leading to a lower and lower error, while the other model has tended to diverge to a poorer model due to the overly high learning rate:\n\n    **...**\n    **14/11/16 14:57:30 INFO SparkContext: Job finished: mean at StreamingModel.scala:159, took 0.069175 s**\n\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n    **Time: 1416142650000 ms**\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n\n    **MSE current batch: Model 1: 75.54543031658632; Model 2: 10318.213926882852**\n    **RMSE current batch: Model 1: 8.691687426304878; Model 2: 101.57860959317593**\n    **...**\n\nIf you leave the program running for a number of minutes, you should eventually see the first model's error rate getting quite small:\n\n    **...**\n    **14/11/16 17:27:00 INFO SparkContext: Job finished: mean at StreamingModel.scala:159, took 0.037856 s**\n\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n    **Time: 1416151620000 ms**\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n\n    **MSE current batch: Model 1: 6.551475362521364; Model 2: 1.057088005456417E26**\n    **RMSE current batch: Model 1: 2.559584998104451; Model 2: 1.0281478519436867E13**\n    **...**\n\n### Tip\n\nNote again that due to random data generation, you might see different results, but the overall result should be the same--in the first batch, the models will have the same error, and subsequently, the first model should start to generate to a smaller and smaller error.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we connected some of the dots between online machine learning and streaming data analysis. We introduced the Spark Streaming library and API for continuous processing of data streams based on familiar RDD functionality and worked through examples of streaming analytics applications that illustrate this functionality.\n\nFinally, we used MLlib's streaming regression model in a streaming application that involves computing and comparing model performance on a stream of input feature vectors.\n\n# Index\n\n## A\n\n  * Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) / Extracting facial images as vectors\n  * accumulators / Broadcast variables and accumulators\n  * additive smoothing\n    * URL / The

major project library) called **Spark Streaming** , which focuses on processing data streams in real time.\n\nA data stream is a continuous sequence of records. Common examples include activity stream data from a web or mobile application, time-stamped log data, transactional data, and event streams from sensor or device networks.\n\nThe batch processing approach typically involves saving the data stream to an intermediate storage system (for example, HDFS or a database) and running a batch process on the saved data. In order to generate up-to-date results, the batch process must be run periodically (for example, daily, hourly, or even every few minutes) on the latest data available.\n\nBy contrast, the stream-based approach applies processing to the data stream as it is generated. This allows near real-time processing (of the order of a subsecond to a few tenths of a second time frames rather than minutes, hours, days, or even weeks with typical batch processing).\n\n## An introduction to Spark Streaming\n\nThere are a few different general techniques to deal with stream processing. Two of the most common ones are as follows:\n\n  * Treat each record individually and process it as soon as it is seen.\n  * Combine multiple records into **mini-batches**. These mini-batches can be delineated either by time or by the number of records in a batch.\n\nSpark Streaming takes the second approach. The core primitive in Spark Streaming is the **discretized stream** , or **DStream**. A DStream is a sequence of mini-batches, where each mini-batch is represented as a Spark RDD:\n\nThe discretized stream abstraction\n\nA DStream is defined by its input source and a time window called the **batch interval**. The stream is broken up into time periods equal to the batch interval (beginning from the starting time of the application). Each RDD in the stream will contain the records that are received by the Spark Streaming application during a given batch interval. If no data is present in a given interval, the RDD will simply be empty.\n\n### Input sources\n\nSpark Streaming **receivers** are responsible for receiving data from an **input source** and converting the raw data into a DStream made up of Spark RDDs.\n\nSpark Streaming supports various input sources, including file-based sources (where the receiver watches for new files arriving at the input location and creates the DStream from the contents read from each new file) and network-based sources (such as receivers that communicate with socket-based sources, the Twitter API stream, Akka actors, or message queues and distributed stream and log transfer frameworks, such Flume, Kafka, and Amazon Kinesis).\n\n### Note\n\nSee the documentation on input sources at <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#input-dstreams> for more details and for links to various advanced sources.\n\n### Transformations\n\nAs we saw in Chapter 1, _Getting Up and Running with Spark_ , and throughout this book, Spark allows us to apply powerful transformations to RDDs. As DStreams are made up of RDDs, Spark Streaming provides a set of transformations available on DStreams; these transformations are similar to those available on RDDs. These include `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `join`, and `reduceByKey`.\n\nSpark Streaming transformations, such as those applicable to RDDs, operate on each element of a DStream's underlying data. That is, the transformations are effectively applied to each RDD in the DStream, which, in turn, applies the transformation to the elements of the RDD.\n\nSpark Streaming also provides operators such as `reduce` and `count`. These operators return a DStream made up of a single element (for example, the count value for each batch). Unlike the equivalent operators on RDDs, these do not trigger computation on DStreams directly. That is, they are not **actions** , but they are still transformations, as they return another DStream.\n\n#### Keeping track of state\n\nWhen we were dealing with batch processing of RDDs, keeping and updating a state variable was relatively straightforward. We could start with a certain state (for example, a count or sum of values) and then use broadcast variables or accumulators to update this state in parallel. Usually, we would then use an RDD action to collect the updated state to the driver and, in turn, update the global state.\n\nWith DStreams, this is a little more complex, as we need to keep track of states across batches in a fault-tolerant manner. Conveniently, Spark Streaming provides the `updateStateByKey` function on a DStream of key-value pairs, which takes care of this for us, allowing us to create a stream of arbitrary state information and update it with each batch of data seen. For example, the state could be a global count of the number of times each key has been seen. The state could, thus, represent the number of visits per web page, clicks per advert, tweets per user, or purchases per product, for example.\n\n#### General transformations\n\nThe Spark Streaming API also exposes a general `transform` function that gives us access to the underlying RDD for each batch in the stream. That is, where the higher level functions such as `map` transform a DStream to another DStream, `transform` allows us to apply functions from an RDD to another RDD. For example, we can use the RDD `join` operator to join each batch of the stream to an existing RDD that we computed separately from our streaming application (perhaps, in Spark or some other system).\n\n### Note\n\nThe full list of transformations and further information"""],
        response="Spark Streaming enables real-time data processing by leveraging its core concept of **Discretized Streams (DStreams)**, which are sequences of mini-batches of data. It processes data as it arrives rather than waiting for a complete dataset, allowing for near-instantaneous analytics. DStreams are built from input sources, and Spark Streaming can handle various data sources like files and network streams.The framework allows for operations such as transformations and actions similar to those available for RDDs, providing the ability to process each batch of data individually or apply functions to the entire stream. Additionally, Spark Streaming supports fault tolerance mechanisms, ensuring reliable processing even when failures occur by allowing batches to be recomputed as necessary.This architecture and functionality make Spark Streaming a robust tool for applications that require live data insights and action.",

        retrieved_contexts=["""use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to catch the drippings is necessary.\n\nMost beekeepers do manage to find an extractor. They are expensive, though—prices start at over $200 for a small one. You could share the cost, of course, and buy one cooperatively with one or more other beekeepers. Another possibility is to build one. This can be done without much difficulty for someone so inclined; plans for building a small extractor inexpensively do exist. Another possibility is to rent one. Many beekeeping equipment suppliers keep a rental unit on hand, so ask around.\n\nAssuming that you have located an extractor, what else do you need? Several things. First, a place to work. Extracting is messy. Even processing a small amount of honey can spread stickiness over a large area. In the early days I extracted in the kitchen. This is no problem, but be prepared for lots of cleanup. Maybe it won't be that bad for you—maybe you are a neat worker.\n\nBesides a place, you should allow plenty of time. If you decide to do it in the kitchen, don't try to sneak it in between 3 o'clock and dinner. You won't be finished in time, especially during your first attempt when you are not really sure of what you are doing. Wait until evening.\n\n### **Additional Equipment**\n\nSome additional equipment is necessary—uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, pails, honey gates, bottling tank. Let's discuss each one.\n\nTools useful for uncapping frames include (top to bottom): a kitchen carving knife, a capping scratcher, and an electric knife.\n\n**Uncapping knife.** Some kind of blade is necessary to remove the wax cappings from the comb before you can extract. The beekeeping catalogs show several uncapping knives and a plane. They are relatively expensive, even for the nonelectric versions. Consider using one of your kitchen knives the first time you extract. For one or two supers, it will be adequate. A serrated bread knife or carving knife works well, and if the blade is warmed in a pan of water periodically, it will work better.\n\nIf you are ready for something more sophisticated, your choice is between an electric knife and an electric plane. My preference is for the knife. I find the plane too heavy and awkward, but many beekeepers prefer it.\n\n**Capping scratcher.** This handy tool gets the low spots. A frame of honey, especially one newly drawn and filled, may not be drawn to a uniform depth. The uncapping knife, as it is moves across the frame, may miss some of the cappings. The scratcher can be dragged across these missed cappings to break them up.\n\n**Cappings container.** As you uncap, you will need a container, a tub or pail, to catch the cappings. They tend to flop as they fall free from the comb, so a wide container is best. A large amount of excellent honey adheres to these cappings. The container should ideally have a strainer near the bottom for the cappings to rest on and a gate or valve at the low point for removing that honey after it drains through.\n\n**Strainer.** As the honey comes from the extractor, it contains particles of wax, bits of propolis, occasional wings or legs, and other hive debris. You have a choice. You may strain it through a coarse or medium mesh of cloth or metal as it comes from the extractor. Alternatively, you can run it directly into a pail or other holding container and leave it for 24 hours or more in a warm room. At the end of that time the impurities will have risen to the top and can be skimmed off. After either coarse straining or skimming, you may wish to strain the honey through a filter cloth (70-mesh nylon, for instance) to remove any very fine particles remaining.\n\nFollowing extraction, the honey may be strained to remove coarse particles of wax, propolis, and other hive debris.\n\n**Plastic pails.** A beekeeper never seems to have enough pails. The 5-gallon size is most commonly used, with the 4-gallon running second. Larger pails are available, but honey is heavy and the larger ones can be awkward to handle. Pails can be purchased from some bee supply dealers and from other sources, but used ones are often available free or at small cost from bakeries and restaurants. Use _only_ food-quality containers—those that were manufactured to contain food and have been used exclusively for food. Food-quality pails are usually white, but being white does not guarantee their quality. Be sure to inquire about their past use.\n\n**Honey gates.** In beekeeper parlance, a gate is another name for the valve or faucet used in honey containers. Honey is a thick and viscous material. It needs a valve that shuts off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled,", ".\n\nBe careful in using and storing the fume board and the bottle of liquid. Do not store them in the house. The odor is foul, strong, and persistent. If you spill any on your clothing, you will not be welcome in polite company.\n\nA household blower commonly used for clearing fallen leaves is also effective at removing bees from the super.\n\n#### **Blower**\n\nA blower is a surprisingly effective way to remove bees from supers. It is an expense that may not be justifiable for one or two hives, though. But many households already have a suitable blower—the type used for moving leaves in a yard. Even some of the better shop vacuums may work when operated in reverse, but they require electricity, which is usually not found in the beeyard.\n\nTo use a blower, first remove the super and stand it on one end next to the hive. A stand or platform is helpful; an empty hive body works. Position the super with the bottom toward you so that the bees will be blown toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow up and down and back and forth between the frames until all or at least most of the bees are out.\n\nWhen blowing bees from the super, place the super on its end (with the bottom toward you) and blow the bees toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow between the frames.\n\nA super with lots of burr and bridge comb is difficult to clear. The bees hide behind the obstructions. Sometimes turning the super and blowing from the top does the job.\n\nNone of the methods described above is foolproof. For any of the last four, you may find that you must resort to a brush to get the last few bees out. Be prepared for this and always have a brush with you.\n\n#### **What to Do Next**\n\nYou _must_ protect the honey once you have the supers off the hive—no matter what method you use for clearing the bees. The degree and nature of the protection depends on how long it will be before you actually extract the honey from the supers. Your first concern is to put the supers under cover so the bees cannot recover their wealth. The process of removing honey from the hives has filled the air with its odor and has no doubt agitated the bees. Some of them will follow the supers and will attempt to steal it back. If you give them any kind of opportunity, they will exploit it and you may lose the crop. It is amazing how much of that honey they are able to squeeze back into the hive, even with no supers in place, once robbing gets underway. And of course, once thievery starts, you can expect other colonies in the neighborhood to join in.\n\nYour first concern, then, is to put the honey inside, preferably in a location where the bees cannot even smell it. If they know it is there—especially if the nectar flow is over—they will hang around continually, trying to get in.\n\nYour second concern is temperature and humidity. Honey flows best when it is warm; cold honey is more difficult to extract. If the honey is being taken from the hive toward the end of the season, before really cold weather sets in, you should be able to extract with little difficulty. To make your job easier, keep the supers at room temperature or higher until you actually do extract.\n\nHoney is hygroscopic: it absorbs and retains moisture. The natural environment inside a healthy hive is such that there is no moisture problem. Once off the hive though, the honey is no longer protected by the bees and may take up atmospheric moisture. High-moisture honey can ferment. Do not be overly concerned about this, however. A day or two's delay is not going to affect the moisture content appreciably. If you must store it for a longer time, though, a dehumidifier in the same room helps maintain or even lower the moisture content.\n\nBe aware that the supers will drip. The process of removing them from the hive has unavoidably broken some of the burr and bridge comb, so that honey oozes and runs out onto the floor. You will need something to catch it. A spare outer cover, inverted, makes a suitable tray.\n\nNow that the honey is off the hive and under cover, we can get on with the extraction process.\n\n### **Extracting and Handling Honey**\n\nExtracting—removing the honey from the supers—is your last big chore of the season. It is a relatively straightforward task, but it has its nuances. The best way to remove honey from the supers, and just about the only way, is to use an extractor, a piece of equipment that whirls the frames and removes the honey by centrifugal force.\n\nOne alternative to an extractor does exist, although it is not a good one: removing the honey-laden comb from the frames and crushing it, either in a mesh bag or in a large strainer. You can make a mesh bag from cheesecloth, nylon, or any other material that will hold back the broken up comb while allowing the honey to strain through. It is a messy process and takes time—24 hours or longer per load—unless you use a press of some sort to squeeze out the honey. It helps to massage the bag and its contents periodically as it drains to encourage the process.\n\nInstead of a mesh bag, you could make or acquire a strainer, such as an oversized colander. It might be necessary to use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to", 'off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled, it is ready for bottling. You can move it directly from a pail into a jar, but only with considerable difficulty and probably with lots of spillage. Because of its viscosity, honey does not pour easily. You need a means to cut off the flow sharply—a bottling tank with a honey gate should, therefore, be considered essential. You can buy a small tank, already made, or you can make one yourself. A 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail with a l¼-inch, threaded, plastic honey gate are all that are needed. Cut a hole low in the side of the pail, insert the gate, screw the nut on the back, and you\'re done. (When you cut the hole, be sure to leave room on the inside for the nut to turn.)\n\n#### **The Extracting Process**\n\nExtractors come in various sizes, measured by the number of frames they will accommodate at one time. Beginners most often use an extractor of two-, three-, or four-frame capacity. Most extractors have a reservoir below the basket where honey can accumulate as you proceed, with a honey gate to drain the reservoir. Depending on the design of the particular extractor, you may wish to keep the gate open so that honey drains through as you work. This way, it will not build up around the bottom of the basket and impede the rotation. However, this means you must have the extractor up on a platform so a pail will fit under the gate. Perhaps your extractor will have an ample reservoir at the bottom and you can allow it to sit on the floor with the gate closed, raising and draining it periodically as you proceed.\n\nThe tangential style is most common for small extractors. Frames are positioned as illustrated, with honey spun from just one side of each frame at a time.\n\nIn a radial extractor, honey is spun from both sides of the frames at once.\n\nAssume that the extractor will vibrate a bit and will try to walk about the room as you work, especially if the load is not balanced. Fasten it down somehow before you start or have a helper hold the extractor in place as you spin. Balance the load as best you can by putting frames of like weight in the same load. If you come to the end of the job without a full load of frames, use previously extracted empty frames to partially balance things.\n\nExtractors come in two styles—tangential and radial. Most of the small extractors are tangential, which means the frames are positioned at an angle to a radius of the extractor tank. This is the style you are most likely to use first. Later, if you expand your operation, you may acquire a radial extractor. In a radial extractor, the frames are positioned along a radius. The difference is that in a tangential extractor, honey is spun from only one side of each frame. In the radial type, honey is spun from both sides at once.\n\n**U SING A TANGENTIAL EXTRACTOR**\n\nTo use a tangential extractor, load up and spin out an estimated one-half of the honey from the first side. Then, remove, reverse, and replace those frames. Spin out all the honey from the second side. Reverse and replace again to finish on the first side. This is a bit of extra handling, but it helps to ensure that the weight of honey on the second side does not push through and break the somewhat tender comb of a new frame. The bees strengthen the comb a little more each year so in subsequent years the comb is not quite so fragile, but a little care in this respect will always be in order.\n\nYou have no doubt heard the expression "slower than cold molasses." Honey is the same—perhaps even slower. If you are able to store the supers in a warm room for a day or so before you extract, the honey comes from the frames much more easily and passes through your strainers more quickly.\n\nAs you process the honey, moving it from one container to another, try to minimize splashing to reduce the possibility of bubbles and foaming. Each step of the extracting, straining, and bottling process has the potential to add air to the honey. Air, of course, is not harmful, but it can be unsightly once the honey is in the jar. Also, allow the honey to sit in the bottling tank at room temperature for at least a few hours, preferably for a day or two. The bubbles rise and can be skimmed. Then bottling through a gate at the bottom should give nice clear honey in the jar.\n\nIf you have only a small quantity of honey from your extracting process, you probably will bottle it as a part of that process. However, if you have had a banner year, perhaps you will be storing some away. In that case, maybe you will choose not to bottle it now.\n\n#### **Storing Your Honey**\n\nHoney granulates. This is a fact of beekeeping life. Granulation (or crystallization) is a natural state of most honeys. It happens as a function of time and of the particular combination of sugars in the honey. Assume that any or all of your honey may granulate at some time or another. The honey is in no way damaged by this natural process and it can be returned to its liquid state with relative ease. A defense against granulation is heat. Judiciously applied, heat can stop or delay"""],
        #retrieved_contexts=['You may want to bring a garden cart or wheelbarrow up close, and perhaps the lawn mower. Be sure all of these will fit in the area you have chosen. Allow at least 3 to 4 feet on all sides of the hive, if possible.\n\nBe careful not to locate a hive on a steep slope. Level ground or a very gentle slope is probably best. A gentle slope is good because it allows cool or moist air to flow down and past the hive and not form a pool around it. If the slope is too steep, you may find covers and other hive parts also flowing down the hill when you set them on the ground. Avoid such steep slopes, as well as depressions where cool or moist air can collect.\n\n#### **Forage Availability**\n\nAn immediate question that occurs to many potential beekeepers is, "Will my chosen location support a colony of bees?" For the most part, you need not be concerned. One or two hives can be successful almost anywhere on the continent. In fact, some unlikely locales can be very successful—bees are often kept in large cities and in suburbs.\n\nThe key to this is the area around you. The normal foraging range for honey bees is 1 to 2 miles and they have been known to travel much greater distances in areas where forage was scarce. The fact that your immediate property has little to sustain the bees is not important. It is its 1-to 2-mile radius that matters. If there is a substantial amount of flowering plants in that radius, you are probably okay.\n\nOf course, if your own property does have good forage, the bees will work it and benefit from its proximity, which they will work first before traveling afield. Bees fly no farther than they must to find food.\n\nAll of this assumes, of course, that the area where you plan to locate your bees is not one already saturated by other beekeepers. If this is the case, you have a couple of choices. Find another locale, or try a hive or two and see what happens. Perhaps the neighborhood isn\'t really saturated. However, if it is, keep in mind that not only will your own bees suffer, but so will those of the other beekeepers that were there first. Consider other options before placing a hive in an area that is obviously already saturated with bees.\n\n### **Equipment and Supplies**\n\nThe array of equipment necessary for successful beekeeping is important and you should know and understand it. Standard equipment has evolved over a long period of time. It meets the needs of both the beekeeper and the bees, and for the most part, has proven its worth. Standard equipment has also evolved to provide specific sizes, dimensions, and configurations suitable to the conditions under which bees are kept in this country. None of this should be taken lightly. To repeat a general rule—stay with the tried and true as a novice. Do not experiment. Learn the basics and work with the standards. After 2 or 3 years, when you are beginning to understand bees and beekeeping, experiment if you wish. By then you will have an idea of what you are deviating from, and if things go wrong you will be able to get back on track with minimum trouble.\n\nIf you look in any beekeeping catalog you will see a myriad of equipment and supplies that can be confusing, perhaps overwhelming. However, the equipment needed for the first year and even beyond is relatively straightforward. Once you have some experience, you will come to understand the catalog offerings and can begin to pick and choose. A good rule is never to buy any piece of equipment without understanding its use and value. Don\'t get carried away by someone else\'s enthusiasm.\n\nOne of the most popular hives configurations—two full-depth, ten-frame hive bodies, with honey supers added during the active beekeeping season.\n\nIn much of this country most beekeepers use two full-depth, ten-frame hive bodies as their basic unit, with honey supers (superstructure) added and removed at appropriate times during the active beekeeping season. However, in some areas, a different configuration may be used: one full-depth body, for instance, or one full-depth and one shallow. Although the standard for most of the country is ten-frame hive bodies and supers, and that is what you will see in just about every catalog, narrower and wider boxes do exist. Eight-frame and eleven-frame units are seen occasionally. A beginner will do well to stay away from these less common sizes. Again, in starting out, stay with the standards.\n\n**B ASIC BEEKEEPING EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe following list includes everything necessary for the entire first season of keeping bees, assuming a two-story, ten-frame configuration.\n\n**Complete Two-Story Hive**\n\n• Bottom board with entrance reducer\n\n• Hive bodies (two), full-depth, 9½-inch\n\n• Frames (ten per hive body) full-depth, 9VB-inch with wedge-style top bar and two-piece or split bottom bar\n\n• Foundation—hook-wired, 8½-inch\n\n• Support pins (four per frame), or frame wire and eyelets\n\n• Inner cover—ventilated\n\n• Outer cover—telescoping\n\n**Honey Supers**\n\n• Super—shallow, 511/16-inch or mid-depth, 6⅝-inch\n\n• Frames (ten per super)—shallow, 5⅜-inch or mid-depth, 6¼\n\n• Foundation—hook-wired, shallow, 4¾-inch or mid-depth, 5⅝ inch\n\n• Support pins (four per frame), or frame wire and eyelets In the long run you will want two or three supers per hive. In the first year you may not need any.\n\n**Bees**\n\n•', "Honey Bees**\n\n**Ants** are mentioned earlier as sometimes living in a hive, but being no real problem. However, in some areas, notably the South, particular species of ants are a serious problem and must be dealt with. These ants invade bee colonies and can cause their demise. Raising the hive on legs and placing the legs in cans of oil is an often practiced defense. Alternatively, the legs can be painted with one of the available sticky substances used to trap insects. Both materials need to be watched and the sticky material especially needs to be renewed periodically. Other solutions to the ant problem may be used locally. If you have these ants, ask around.\n\n**Wax moths** can be a serious problem. However, they are rarely a problem to an otherwise healthy colony. The moths are successful only when a colony has problems that prevent it from policing the hive adequately. Although moths may enter and lay eggs in a normal healthy colony, the bees remove them or the resulting larvae. If the hive is weakened though, the moths are able to get ahead of the bees, laying eggs that successfully hatch. The resulting larvae burrow through the comb, eating impurities in the wax and leaving behind large amounts of webbing and frass. They damage the comb, destroying it completely if unchecked, and sometimes cause the death of maturing brood which become trapped in Wax moths are a particular threat to their cells and are unable to emerge as adults. The bees are largely incapable of coping with the wax moth once it has successfully become established.\n\nWax moths are a particular threat to weak bee colonies or empty equipment, where they may burrow into the comb, eat impurities in the wax, and leave behind extensive webbing and frass.\n\nOccasionally, wax moths will be found in empty supers that have been placed on a hive optimistically. If the supers are not really needed, there is no nectar flow, for instance, or the colony is too small and does not need that much storage space, wax moths may move in to the unoccupied space. In this situation, a problem exists. They can take over and become difficult or impossible for the bees to remove.\n\nThe defense against wax moths in the hive is to maintain the colony in vigorous good health through good hive management. Wax moths also invade comb in empty equipment off the hive. In fact, more damage is probably done to empty equipment in storage or to abandoned equipment than to hives occupied by bees. Care should be taken to protect such equipment during the off season. For this purpose, paradichlorobenzine (PDB), a form of moth crystals, is available. Use only PDB for such protection. Another form of moth protection commonly available, napthalene, should not be used. Residual napthalene in the comb can harm bees. PDB has no effect on bees if the comb is aired for 24 hours or so before use.\n\nTo protect unused equipment containing comb, stack the supers or hive bodies on a solid, even surface that will prevent rodents from entering at the bottom. Counting up from the bottom of the stack, place a sheet of paper about 6 to 8 inches square on the top bars of the frames of every third or fourth super. Deposit about ⅓ cup of PDB crystals on each piece of paper. Cover the top of the stack. A spare outer cover is ideal, but anything to keep out rodents will do. Over time the PDB crystals will vaporize. The vapors, being heavier than air, will settle through the stack. For long-term storage, the PDB may need to be renewed periodically.\n\nBecause wax moths are killed by freezing temperatures, they are less of a problem in the more northern parts of the country. But protect against them wherever you live.\n\nMice find a beehive to be a wonderful place to spend the winter and they can cause a great deal of damage. You should assume that a mouse will find your hive at some time or another, so be prepared. Keep them out.\n\nThe mouse enters on cool nights in the fall when the bees are clustered. It chews a hole several inches in diameter and builds a spherical nest through several frames of comb. The nest is made of materials the mouse brings in—grass, leaves, and other typical mouse nest material. The mouse apparently builds this nest at a time when it is too cold for the bees to break their cluster. Once complete, the mouse can stop up its entrance to keep bees out if the weather warms up.\n\nIn the worst case situation, a mouse can create enough disruption to cause the colony to abscond. Occasionally, the bees are able to attack the mouse and kill it. Since they cannot move it, they then may embalm it with propolis.\n\nThe best defense against mice is a metal guard over the entrance. Mice can chew through a wooden entrance reducer or most other wooden barriers. A strip cut from %-inch wire mesh will serve, or obtain one of the metal guards made for the purpose.\n\nDon't delay in placing that mouse guard in the fall. Late summer may even be better—mice get ready for winter early.\n\nSkunks enjoy a meal of adult bees, which they catch alive at the hive entrance. They are seemingly impervious to bee stings and at times are a serious pest of beehives. Over a period of days, a skunk can severely weaken a colony.\n\nThe skunk approaches the hive entrance at night, scratches on the landing board, and catches individual bees as they come out to investigate. Each bee is caught in the skunk's paw, rolled on the ground and killed, and then popped into the skunk's mouth.\n\nThere are several kinds of evidence of a skunk's depredations. One sign is the holes it digs around the yard as it feeds on grubs in your lawn. Then, just in front of the", "We will be able to continue keeping bees successfully only after all beekeepers come to understand the state of beekeeping today, and accept their responsibilities.\n\n#### **Regulations about Bees**\n\nNo federal laws exist in this country that regulate beekeeping, except the one that bans the importation of live bees. The parasitic mites mentioned above are not native to the Western Hemisphere and have been in North America only since the mid-1980s. We do not know specifically how they came into this country, but they were probably brought in illegally with queen bees—a violation of this federal ban.\n\nLaws or regulations governing bees do exist at the state level and vary from state to state. Some states totally ban importation of live bees. Others allow importation, but only when specific conditions are met (for instance, a certificate of inspection from the originating state showing that the bees were inspected within a certain recent period and are free of disease and mites). As the Africanized bee spreads, further regulation is probable. Some moves have been made toward more uniform regulations from state to state, but little progress has been made.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each individual beekeeper to be aware of the specific laws and regulations of the state(s) in which he or she keeps bees and to follow these laws and regulations faithfully. Too much is at stake to allow anyone to go his or her own way. Mites, undetected or untreated, can wipe out a beekeeper's holdings. Seemingly unprovoked stinging attacks, as from Africanized bees or from any bees that the public may perceive to be Africanized, can result in a total ban of bees from specified areas. Unfortunately, the public and the representatives of many official agencies who should be better informed, do not understand the scope and importance of honeybees to our way of life. Perhaps we will someday have alternatives, but for now we cannot do without honey bees. It is not an exaggeration to say that our present diet, a large part of our environment, and, in turn, our way of life is dependent on the pollination services of honeybees.\n\nYour mentor, if you have one, your local beekeeping organization, or your local equipment supplier should be able to help you find out about the laws and regulations in your state and municipality. Other sources include your state's department of agriculture and the cooperative extension system.\n\n### **History of Beekeeping**\n\nThe history of beekeeping may sound like a rather dull topic to someone who is anxious to get some bees and begin. However, certain of our practices, techniques, and current attitudes result from or are carried over from the earlier days of beekeeping. It is thus helpful to know at least a smattering of the history of the craft.\n\nBees have been kept, or at least exploited, as far back as we have records. Primitive people robbed bees of their honey, as is evidenced by ancient cave paintings. Stone-Age people probably kept bees in some manner and can be considered the first beekeepers. After that early period, we can identify at least three eras of beekeeping: the first, from ancient times until about 1500; the second, from about 1500 until 1850; and the third, from 1850 until the present. Perhaps we are now actually in a fourth era, one marked by extensive research and resultant discoveries, by the ever-increasing role of bees as pollinators of commercial crops, by the pressures of human growth and population, and by the problems of the day—mites and Africanized bees.\n\nOne of the earliest hives was made from a section of naturally hollow log. Such hives could still be found in use this century.\n\n#### **The First Era**\n\nDuring the first era, pre-1500, beekeeping was more properly beehaving; that is, people had, rather than kept, bees. The term still has application today. In those early days, bees were exploited more than kept. Honey was, no doubt, simply collected from a hollow tree or whatever other space the bees had found to build their nest. When bees were kept in containers provided by the beekeeper, these early hives were small, probably by necessity, because in early times tools were limited and large containers hard to come by. Furthermore, because of the beekeeper's limited knowledge of bees and colony management, swarming was encouraged. Collecting swarms was the only method available to increase holdings and to replace winter losses. Small containers would also encourage swarming. Hives were made of whatever was available to the particular culture—pottery, woven material, mud and wattle, or a section of hollow log. Later, the more advanced societies employed skeps (domed hives made of twisted straw).\n\nThe skep was an immediate precursor of our modern wooden hives.\n\nAll of these early hives were crude, at least by our standards. Access was from the bottom or end. No one had worked out a method for removing the comb. The only means known to remove the honey was to cut out and crush the comb. The result was that the colony probably died, either immediately, or later for lack of food.\n\nThe philosophy of early beekeeping was simple: have many hives, swarms are good, kill off the good honey producers in the fall in order to take their honey, start over in the spring, encourage those overwintered hives (the weak ones) to swarm. The result—breed to a weakness, breed to swarm.\n\nVery little was known about the bees themselves during this early era, and what was known tended to be localized. The Romans developed some knowledge. They fed the bees in times of need and began to wonder about them, but they had little or no understanding of what went on in the hive. This was at least in part because it was difficult to observe life in a", "use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to catch the drippings is necessary.\n\nMost beekeepers do manage to find an extractor. They are expensive, though—prices start at over $200 for a small one. You could share the cost, of course, and buy one cooperatively with one or more other beekeepers. Another possibility is to build one. This can be done without much difficulty for someone so inclined; plans for building a small extractor inexpensively do exist. Another possibility is to rent one. Many beekeeping equipment suppliers keep a rental unit on hand, so ask around.\n\nAssuming that you have located an extractor, what else do you need? Several things. First, a place to work. Extracting is messy. Even processing a small amount of honey can spread stickiness over a large area. In the early days I extracted in the kitchen. This is no problem, but be prepared for lots of cleanup. Maybe it won't be that bad for you—maybe you are a neat worker.\n\nBesides a place, you should allow plenty of time. If you decide to do it in the kitchen, don't try to sneak it in between 3 o'clock and dinner. You won't be finished in time, especially during your first attempt when you are not really sure of what you are doing. Wait until evening.\n\n### **Additional Equipment**\n\nSome additional equipment is necessary—uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, pails, honey gates, bottling tank. Let's discuss each one.\n\nTools useful for uncapping frames include (top to bottom): a kitchen carving knife, a capping scratcher, and an electric knife.\n\n**Uncapping knife.** Some kind of blade is necessary to remove the wax cappings from the comb before you can extract. The beekeeping catalogs show several uncapping knives and a plane. They are relatively expensive, even for the nonelectric versions. Consider using one of your kitchen knives the first time you extract. For one or two supers, it will be adequate. A serrated bread knife or carving knife works well, and if the blade is warmed in a pan of water periodically, it will work better.\n\nIf you are ready for something more sophisticated, your choice is between an electric knife and an electric plane. My preference is for the knife. I find the plane too heavy and awkward, but many beekeepers prefer it.\n\n**Capping scratcher.** This handy tool gets the low spots. A frame of honey, especially one newly drawn and filled, may not be drawn to a uniform depth. The uncapping knife, as it is moves across the frame, may miss some of the cappings. The scratcher can be dragged across these missed cappings to break them up.\n\n**Cappings container.** As you uncap, you will need a container, a tub or pail, to catch the cappings. They tend to flop as they fall free from the comb, so a wide container is best. A large amount of excellent honey adheres to these cappings. The container should ideally have a strainer near the bottom for the cappings to rest on and a gate or valve at the low point for removing that honey after it drains through.\n\n**Strainer.** As the honey comes from the extractor, it contains particles of wax, bits of propolis, occasional wings or legs, and other hive debris. You have a choice. You may strain it through a coarse or medium mesh of cloth or metal as it comes from the extractor. Alternatively, you can run it directly into a pail or other holding container and leave it for 24 hours or more in a warm room. At the end of that time the impurities will have risen to the top and can be skimmed off. After either coarse straining or skimming, you may wish to strain the honey through a filter cloth (70-mesh nylon, for instance) to remove any very fine particles remaining.\n\nFollowing extraction, the honey may be strained to remove coarse particles of wax, propolis, and other hive debris.\n\n**Plastic pails.** A beekeeper never seems to have enough pails. The 5-gallon size is most commonly used, with the 4-gallon running second. Larger pails are available, but honey is heavy and the larger ones can be awkward to handle. Pails can be purchased from some bee supply dealers and from other sources, but used ones are often available free or at small cost from bakeries and restaurants. Use _only_ food-quality containers—those that were manufactured to contain food and have been used exclusively for food. Food-quality pails are usually white, but being white does not guarantee their quality. Be sure to inquire about their past use.\n\n**Honey gates.** In beekeeper parlance, a gate is another name for the valve or faucet used in honey containers. Honey is a thick and viscous material. It needs a valve that shuts off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled,", "careful with the comb in doing so; it is not as strong as wired extracting comb. Next year, give these frames back as extracting comb. The bees will strengthen it with wax and propolis and in 2 or 3 years you may have difficulty distinguishing it from regular wired comb.\n\nCut comb honey can be conveniently packed in square plastic boxes, available from bee equipment suppliers.\n\nIf all went well and you do have some acceptable comb honey, cut it carefully from the frames with a warm knife. Some cells will be cut open in the process and, as a result, honey will run. Allow the sections to drain on a wire rack over a shallow pan for a few hours in a warm room, then pack it in boxes. Draining is not absolutely required; it is primarily for appearance. Otherwise the comb section would sit in the box in an unsightly puddle.\n\nUse square plastic boxes, available from bee equipment suppliers, to pack comb honey. A shallow frame, completely filled, will yield four equal sections of comb that fit these boxes perfectly. If the frames are not completely filled, cut out the best parts and put the scraps in a bowl. Leave it out to snack on—it's delicious.\n\nThe question often arises about how to use comb honey. It is often eaten directly, by the spoonful, as a substitute for candy. The wax is edible. It can be chewed up and swallowed or treated like gum—once the goodness is chewed out, dispose of it. Comb honey can also be spread on toast or muffins, wax and all.\n\nIf you have only a modest number of sections, your family will use them quickly. Otherwise, they make wonderful gifts. And a gift of comb honey is a good way to introduce people to one of the pleasures of beekeeping, especially those neighbors who may be a little apprehensive about your bees.\n\nFor long-term storage, place the sections of comb in a plastic bag in the freezer so they do not granulate. However, even granulated, it is good to eat.\n\n### **Other Hive Products**\n\nDuring your first year or two as a beekeeper, you should not be overly concerned with other hive products, but be aware of them. They are of interest to many people and you will probably be questioned. The five other products of the hive that are frequently discussed (and sometimes collected) are beeswax, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, and venom. Two of these have further uses by beekeepers, but other uses exist for all five, primarily as natural food or health supplements. The efficacy of some of these health uses is not conclusive.\n\n#### **Beeswax**\n\nBeeswax has a variety of uses. A very large quantity is recycled to become the beeswax foundation we use in our hives. It is commonly used in candles, either pure or mixed with paraffin; it is often an ingredient in certain types of cosmetics, creams, and salves; and it is sometimes a component in wood and metal polishes.\n\n**A PITHERAPY**\n\nApitherapy, sometimes written apiotherapy, is the collective term used to cover any aspect of health treatment involving products of the hive. As such, it covers all the products discussed here, including honey. This is a growing field of interest and study, and though much of the medical community does not agree, it is a field that holds promise. At least one organization exists in the United States to further this work—the American Apitherapy Society, P.O. Box 74, North Hartland, VT 05052.\n\nOver time, a beekeeper tends to accumulate significant quantities of wax, which come from three basic sources: cappings from the honey extracting process, scrapings of burr and bridge comb from working the hive, and melted down older comb. As a new beekeeper, you are not likely to have much, if any, of the latter. Presumably, your comb is new and will remain in good condition for at least 3 or 4 years. After that you will start to recycle some of the comb as it ages and deteriorates.\n\nCappings and scrapings, when melted down and cleaned, usually yield high-quality, light-colored wax. This should be kept separate from melted-down brood comb, which is almost certainly dark and contains impurities not easily removed by the beekeeper. The lighter waxes command premium prices when sold and are the only acceptable wax for use in candles and salves, for instance. The darker waxes can be treated in industrial processes to bleach their color, but this is not something a small operator can easily do.\n\n#### **Pollen**\n\nPollen is often collected at the hive by beekeepers and fed back to the bees in times of need, or sold as a health food supplement. Special pollen-trapping apparatus is available from bee supply sources. During its first season, a colony should not be subjected to the stresses of pollen trapping. Later, you may choose to do so, but it is a subject to be researched carefully first.\n\nPollen is often touted as a perfect food for humans because it is said to contain all of the vitamins and the minerals necessary for human health. Users frequently extol its benefits. No one seriously questions whether pollen does in fact contain these vitamins and minerals. There is a question, however, as to whether the human body is capable of breaking down pollen and using it.\n\nA further concern is that we are often not aware of the source of pollen offered for sale. There is no convenient way to know if the pollen was collected from plants recently treated with pesticides. This can be a concern even with your own bees. You are never sure where they have been foraging.\n\n#### **Propolis**\n\nPropolis is a resinous substance collected by the bees from the bark and buds of trees and other plant materials. It is used in the hive to seal up cracks and crevices, making the hive", ".\n\nBe careful in using and storing the fume board and the bottle of liquid. Do not store them in the house. The odor is foul, strong, and persistent. If you spill any on your clothing, you will not be welcome in polite company.\n\nA household blower commonly used for clearing fallen leaves is also effective at removing bees from the super.\n\n#### **Blower**\n\nA blower is a surprisingly effective way to remove bees from supers. It is an expense that may not be justifiable for one or two hives, though. But many households already have a suitable blower—the type used for moving leaves in a yard. Even some of the better shop vacuums may work when operated in reverse, but they require electricity, which is usually not found in the beeyard.\n\nTo use a blower, first remove the super and stand it on one end next to the hive. A stand or platform is helpful; an empty hive body works. Position the super with the bottom toward you so that the bees will be blown toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow up and down and back and forth between the frames until all or at least most of the bees are out.\n\nWhen blowing bees from the super, place the super on its end (with the bottom toward you) and blow the bees toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow between the frames.\n\nA super with lots of burr and bridge comb is difficult to clear. The bees hide behind the obstructions. Sometimes turning the super and blowing from the top does the job.\n\nNone of the methods described above is foolproof. For any of the last four, you may find that you must resort to a brush to get the last few bees out. Be prepared for this and always have a brush with you.\n\n#### **What to Do Next**\n\nYou _must_ protect the honey once you have the supers off the hive—no matter what method you use for clearing the bees. The degree and nature of the protection depends on how long it will be before you actually extract the honey from the supers. Your first concern is to put the supers under cover so the bees cannot recover their wealth. The process of removing honey from the hives has filled the air with its odor and has no doubt agitated the bees. Some of them will follow the supers and will attempt to steal it back. If you give them any kind of opportunity, they will exploit it and you may lose the crop. It is amazing how much of that honey they are able to squeeze back into the hive, even with no supers in place, once robbing gets underway. And of course, once thievery starts, you can expect other colonies in the neighborhood to join in.\n\nYour first concern, then, is to put the honey inside, preferably in a location where the bees cannot even smell it. If they know it is there—especially if the nectar flow is over—they will hang around continually, trying to get in.\n\nYour second concern is temperature and humidity. Honey flows best when it is warm; cold honey is more difficult to extract. If the honey is being taken from the hive toward the end of the season, before really cold weather sets in, you should be able to extract with little difficulty. To make your job easier, keep the supers at room temperature or higher until you actually do extract.\n\nHoney is hygroscopic: it absorbs and retains moisture. The natural environment inside a healthy hive is such that there is no moisture problem. Once off the hive though, the honey is no longer protected by the bees and may take up atmospheric moisture. High-moisture honey can ferment. Do not be overly concerned about this, however. A day or two's delay is not going to affect the moisture content appreciably. If you must store it for a longer time, though, a dehumidifier in the same room helps maintain or even lower the moisture content.\n\nBe aware that the supers will drip. The process of removing them from the hive has unavoidably broken some of the burr and bridge comb, so that honey oozes and runs out onto the floor. You will need something to catch it. A spare outer cover, inverted, makes a suitable tray.\n\nNow that the honey is off the hive and under cover, we can get on with the extraction process.\n\n### **Extracting and Handling Honey**\n\nExtracting—removing the honey from the supers—is your last big chore of the season. It is a relatively straightforward task, but it has its nuances. The best way to remove honey from the supers, and just about the only way, is to use an extractor, a piece of equipment that whirls the frames and removes the honey by centrifugal force.\n\nOne alternative to an extractor does exist, although it is not a good one: removing the honey-laden comb from the frames and crushing it, either in a mesh bag or in a large strainer. You can make a mesh bag from cheesecloth, nylon, or any other material that will hold back the broken up comb while allowing the honey to strain through. It is a messy process and takes time—24 hours or longer per load—unless you use a press of some sort to squeeze out the honey. It helps to massage the bag and its contents periodically as it drains to encourage the process.\n\nInstead of a mesh bag, you could make or acquire a strainer, such as an oversized colander. It might be necessary to use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved.

To make your job easier, keep the supers at room temperature or higher until you actually do extract.\n\nHoney is hygroscopic: it absorbs and retains moisture. The natural environment inside a healthy hive is such that there is no moisture problem. Once off the hive though, the honey is no longer protected by the bees and may take up atmospheric moisture. High-moisture honey can ferment. Do not be overly concerned about this, however. A day or two's delay is not going to affect the moisture content appreciably. If you must store it for a longer time, though, a dehumidifier in the same room helps maintain or even lower the moisture content.\n\nBe aware that the supers will drip. The process of removing them from the hive has unavoidably broken some of the burr and bridge comb, so that honey oozes and runs out onto the floor. You will need something to catch it. A spare outer cover, inverted, makes a suitable tray.\n\nNow that the honey is off the hive and under cover, we can get on with the extraction process.\n\n### **Extracting and Handling Honey**\n\nExtracting—removing the honey from the supers—is your last big chore of the season. It is a relatively straightforward task, but it has its nuances. The best way to remove honey from the supers, and just about the only way, is to use an extractor, a piece of equipment that whirls the frames and removes the honey by centrifugal force.\n\nOne alternative to an extractor does exist, although it is not a good one: removing the honey-laden comb from the frames and crushing it, either in a mesh bag or in a large strainer. You can make a mesh bag from cheesecloth, nylon, or any other material that will hold back the broken up comb while allowing the honey to strain through. It is a messy process and takes time—24 hours or longer per load—unless you use a press of some sort to squeeze out the honey. It helps to massage the bag and its contents periodically as it drains to encourage the process.\n\nInstead of a mesh bag, you could make or acquire a strainer, such as an oversized colander. It might be necessary to use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to", 'off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled, it is ready for bottling. You can move it directly from a pail into a jar, but only with considerable difficulty and probably with lots of spillage. Because of its viscosity, honey does not pour easily. You need a means to cut off the flow sharply—a bottling tank with a honey gate should, therefore, be considered essential. You can buy a small tank, already made, or you can make one yourself. A 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail with a l¼-inch, threaded, plastic honey gate are all that are needed. Cut a hole low in the side of the pail, insert the gate, screw the nut on the back, and you\'re done. (When you cut the hole, be sure to leave room on the inside for the nut to turn.)\n\n#### **The Extracting Process**\n\nExtractors come in various sizes, measured by the number of frames they will accommodate at one time. Beginners most often use an extractor of two-, three-, or four-frame capacity. Most extractors have a reservoir below the basket where honey can accumulate as you proceed, with a honey gate to drain the reservoir. Depending on the design of the particular extractor, you may wish to keep the gate open so that honey drains through as you work. This way, it will not build up around the bottom of the basket and impede the rotation. However, this means you must have the extractor up on a platform so a pail will fit under the gate. Perhaps your extractor will have an ample reservoir at the bottom and you can allow it to sit on the floor with the gate closed, raising and draining it periodically as you proceed.\n\nThe tangential style is most common for small extractors. Frames are positioned as illustrated, with honey spun from just one side of each frame at a time.\n\nIn a radial extractor, honey is spun from both sides of the frames at once.\n\nAssume that the extractor will vibrate a bit and will try to walk about the room as you work, especially if the load is not balanced. Fasten it down somehow before you start or have a helper hold the extractor in place as you spin. Balance the load as best you can by putting frames of like weight in the same load. If you come to the end of the job without a full load of frames, use previously extracted empty frames to partially balance things.\n\nExtractors come in two styles—tangential and radial. Most of the small extractors are tangential, which means the frames are positioned at an angle to a radius of the extractor tank. This is the style you are most likely to use first. Later, if you expand your operation, you may acquire a radial extractor. In a radial extractor, the frames are positioned along a radius. The difference is that in a tangential extractor, honey is spun from only one side of each frame. In the radial type, honey is spun from both sides at once.\n\n**U SING A TANGENTIAL EXTRACTOR**\n\nTo use a tangential extractor, load up and spin out an estimated one-half of the honey from the first side. Then, remove, reverse, and replace those frames. Spin out all the honey from the second side. Reverse and replace again to finish on the first side. This is a bit of extra handling, but it helps to ensure that the weight of honey on the second side does not push through and break the somewhat tender comb of a new frame. The bees strengthen the comb a little more each year so in subsequent years the comb is not quite so fragile, but a little care in this respect will always be in order.\n\nYou have no doubt heard the expression "slower than cold molasses." Honey is the same—perhaps even slower. If you are able to store the supers in a warm room for a day or so before you extract, the honey comes from the frames much more easily and passes through your strainers more quickly.\n\nAs you process the honey, moving it from one container to another, try to minimize splashing to reduce the possibility of bubbles and foaming. Each step of the extracting, straining, and bottling process has the potential to add air to the honey. Air, of course, is not harmful, but it can be unsightly once the honey is in the jar. Also, allow the honey to sit in the bottling tank at room temperature for at least a few hours, preferably for a day or two. The bubbles rise and can be skimmed. Then bottling through a gate at the bottom should give nice clear honey in the jar.\n\nIf you have only a small quantity of honey from your extracting process, you probably will bottle it as a part of that process. However, if you have had a banner year, perhaps you will be storing some away. In that case, maybe you will choose not to bottle it now.\n\n#### **Storing Your Honey**\n\nHoney granulates. This is a fact of beekeeping life. Granulation (or crystallization) is a natural state of most honeys. It happens as a function of time and of the particular combination of sugars in the honey. Assume that any or all of your honey may granulate at some time or another. The honey is in no way damaged by this natural process and it can be returned to its liquid state with relative ease. A defense against granulation is heat. Judiciously applied, heat can stop or delay'],
        response="### Steps in Extracting and Handling Honey1. **Preparation**:- Set up a space for extraction, as it can be messy. It’s advisable to choose a clean area where spills can be managed easily.- Gather necessary equipment: extractor, uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, plastic pails, honey gates, and a bottling tank.2. **Removing Bees**:- Clear bees from the supers using methods such as a household blower or a brush. Position the super on its end and direct airflow between the frames to remove bees.3. **Uncapping**:- Use an uncapping knife or capping scratcher to remove the wax cappings from the frames. This step is crucial as it allows honey to flow out during extraction.4. **Extracting Honey**:- Load extracted frames into an extractor. Extractors can be tangential or radial, with tangential extractors spinning honey from one side of the frame at a time and radial extractors spinning from both sides.- Spin the frames to utilize centrifugal force to remove honey from the frames into a reservoir.5. **Straining**:- After extraction, strain the honey to remove coarse particles such as wax, propolis, and other debris. This involves running the honey through a strainer or letting it sit to allow impurities to rise to the top, which can then be skimmed off.6. **Bottling**:- Transfer the strained honey into a bottling tank equipped with a honey gate for easy dispensing, minimizing spillage### Importance of Straining HoneyStraining honey is essential for several reasons:- **Purity**: It ensures that the honey is free from coarse particles and impurities that could affect its flavor and quality.- **Appearance**: Straining results in a clearer honey without unwanted debris, making it visually appealing when bottled.- **Shelf Stability**: Removing particulate matter helps in preserving the honey and extending its shelf life, as impurities can attract moisture or lead to fermentation if left in the honey.Adequate straining therefore enhances the overall quality and marketability of the honey produced",

"for each batch in the stream. That is, where the higher level functions such as `map` transform a DStream to another DStream, `transform` allows us to apply functions from an RDD to another RDD. For example, we can use the RDD `join` operator to join each batch of the stream to an existing RDD that we computed separately from our streaming application (perhaps, in Spark or some other system).\n\n### Note\n\nThe full list of transformations and further information on each of them is provided in the Spark documentation at <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#transformations-on-dstreams>.\n\n### Actions\n\nWhile some of the operators we have seen in Spark Streaming, such as `count`, are not actions as in the batch RDD case, Spark Streaming has the concept of **actions** on DStreams. Actions are **output** operators that, when invoked, trigger computation on the DStream. They are as follows:\n\n  * `print`: This prints the first 10 elements of each batch to the console and is typically used for debugging and testing.\n  * `saveAsObjectFile`, `saveAsTextFiles`, and `saveAsHadoopFiles`: These functions output each batch to a Hadoop-compatible filesystem with a filename (if applicable) derived from the batch start timestamp.\n  * `forEachRDD`: This operator is the most generic and allows us to apply any arbitrary processing to the RDDs within each batch of a DStream. It is used to apply _side effects_ , such as saving data to an external system, printing it for testing, exporting it to a dashboard, and so on.\n\n### Tip\n\nNote that like batch processing with Spark, DStream operators are **lazy**. In the same way in which we need to call an action, such as `count`, on an RDD to ensure that processing takes place, we need to call one of the preceding action operators in order to trigger computation on a DStream. Otherwise, our streaming application will not actually perform any computation.\n\n### Window operators\n\nAs Spark Streaming operates on time-ordered batched streams of data, it introduces a new concept, which is that of **windowing**. A `window` function computes a transformation over a sliding window applied to the stream.\n\nA window is defined by the length of the window and the sliding interval. For example, with a 10-second window and a 5-second sliding interval, we will compute results every 5 seconds, based on the latest 10 seconds of data in the DStream. For example, we might wish to calculate the top websites by page view numbers over the last 10 seconds and recompute this metric every 5 seconds using a sliding window.\n\nThe following figure illustrates a windowed DStream:\n\nA windowed DStream\n\n## Caching and fault tolerance with Spark Streaming\n\nLike Spark RDDs, DStreams can be cached in memory. The use cases for caching are similar to those for RDDs--if we expect to access the data in a DStream multiple times (perhaps performing multiple types of analysis or aggregation or outputting to multiple external systems), we will benefit from caching the data. Stateful operators, which include `window` functions and `updateStateByKey`, do this automatically for efficiency.\n\nRecall that RDDs are immutable datasets and are defined by their input data source and **lineage** --that is, the set of transformations and actions that are applied to the RDD. Fault tolerance in RDDs works by recreating the RDD (or partition of an RDD) that is lost due to the failure of a worker node.\n\nAs DStreams are themselves batches of RDDs, they can also be recomputed as required to deal with worker node failure. However, this depends on the input data still being available. If the data source itself is fault-tolerant and persistent (such as HDFS or some other fault-tolerant data store), then the DStream can be recomputed.\n\nIf data stream sources are delivered over a network (which is a common case with stream processing), Spark Streaming's default persistence behavior is to replicate data to two worker nodes. This allows network DStreams to be recomputed in the case of failure. Note, however, that any data received by a node but _not yet replicated_ might be lost when a node fails.\n\nSpark Streaming also supports recovery of the driver node in the event of failure. However, currently, for network-based sources, data in the memory of worker nodes will be lost in this case. Hence, Spark Streaming is not fully fault-tolerant in the face of failure of the driver node or application.\n\n### Note\n\nSee http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#caching--persistence and <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#fault-tolerance-properties> for more details.\n\n# Creating a Spark Streaming application\n\nWe will now work through creating our first Spark Streaming application to illustrate some of the basic concepts around Spark Streaming that we introduced earlier.\n\nWe will expand on the example applications used in Chapter 1, _Getting Up and Running with Spark_ , where we used a small example dataset of product purchase events. For this example, instead of using a static set of data, we will create a simple producer application that will randomly generate events and send them over a network connection. We will then create a few Spark Streaming consumer applications that will process this event stream.\n\nThe sample project for this chapter contains the code you will need. It is called `scala-spark-streaming-app`. It consists of a Scala SBT project definition file, the example application source code, and a `\\src\\main\\resources` directory that contains a file called `names.csv`.\n\nThe `build.sbt` file for the project contains the following project definition", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"id": "3", "content": "385965**\n    **...**\n\nSince both models start with the same initial weight vector, we see that they both make the same predictions on this first batch and, therefore, have the same error.\n\nIf we leave the streaming program running for a few minutes, we should eventually see that one of the models has started converging, leading to a lower and lower error, while the other model has tended to diverge to a poorer model due to the overly high learning rate:\n\n    **...**\n    **14/11/16 14:57:30 INFO SparkContext: Job finished: mean at StreamingModel.scala:159, took 0.069175 s**\n\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n    **Time: 1416142650000 ms**\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n\n    **MSE current batch: Model 1: 75.54543031658632; Model 2: 10318.213926882852**\n    **RMSE current batch: Model 1: 8.691687426304878; Model 2: 101.57860959317593**\n    **...**\n\nIf you leave the program running for a number of minutes, you should eventually see the first model's error rate getting quite small:\n\n    **...**\n    **14/11/16 17:27:00 INFO SparkContext: Job finished: mean at StreamingModel.scala:159, took 0.037856 s**\n\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n    **Time: 1416151620000 ms**\n    **-------------------------------------------**\n\n    **MSE current batch: Model 1: 6.551475362521364; Model 2: 1.057088005456417E26**\n    **RMSE current batch: Model 1: 2.559584998104451; Model 2: 1.0281478519436867E13**\n    **...**\n\n### Tip\n\nNote again that due to random data generation, you might see different results, but the overall result should be the same--in the first batch, the models will have the same error, and subsequently, the first model should start to generate to a smaller and smaller error.\n\n# Summary\n\nIn this chapter, we connected some of the dots between online machine learning and streaming data analysis. We introduced the Spark Streaming library and API for continuous processing of data streams based on familiar RDD functionality and worked through examples of streaming analytics applications that illustrate this functionality.\n\nFinally, we used MLlib's streaming regression model in a streaming application that involves computing and comparing model performance on a stream of input feature

stream processing and introduce the Spark Streaming library.\n\nIn addition to the core Spark API and functionality, the Spark project contains another major library (in the same way as MLlib is a major project library) called **Spark Streaming** , which focuses on processing data streams in real time.\n\nA data stream is a continuous sequence of records. Common examples include activity stream data from a web or mobile application, time-stamped log data, transactional data, and event streams from sensor or device networks.\n\nThe batch processing approach typically involves saving the data stream to an intermediate storage system (for example, HDFS or a database) and running a batch process on the saved data. In order to generate up-to-date results, the batch process must be run periodically (for example, daily, hourly, or even every few minutes) on the latest data available.\n\nBy contrast, the stream-based approach applies processing to the data stream as it is generated. This allows near real-time processing (of the order of a subsecond to a few tenths of a second time frames rather than minutes, hours, days, or even weeks with typical batch processing).\n\n## An introduction to Spark Streaming\n\nThere are a few different general techniques to deal with stream processing. Two of the most common ones are as follows:\n\n  * Treat each record individually and process it as soon as it is seen.\n  * Combine multiple records into **mini-batches**. These mini-batches can be delineated either by time or by the number of records in a batch.\n\nSpark Streaming takes the second approach. The core primitive in Spark Streaming is the **discretized stream** , or **DStream**. A DStream is a sequence of mini-batches, where each mini-batch is represented as a Spark RDD:\n\nThe discretized stream abstraction\n\nA DStream is defined by its input source and a time window called the **batch interval**. The stream is broken up into time periods equal to the batch interval (beginning from the starting time of the application). Each RDD in the stream will contain the records that are received by the Spark Streaming application during a given batch interval. If no data is present in a given interval, the RDD will simply be empty.\n\n### Input sources\n\nSpark Streaming **receivers** are responsible for receiving data from an **input source** and converting the raw data into a DStream made up of Spark RDDs.\n\nSpark Streaming supports various input sources, including file-based sources (where the receiver watches for new files arriving at the input location and creates the DStream from the contents read from each new file) and network-based sources (such as receivers that communicate with socket-based sources, the Twitter API stream, Akka actors, or message queues and distributed stream and log transfer frameworks, such Flume, Kafka, and Amazon Kinesis).\n\n### Note\n\nSee the documentation on input sources at <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/streaming-programming-guide.html#input-dstreams> for more details and for links to various advanced sources.\n\n### Transformations\n\nAs we saw in Chapter 1, _Getting Up and Running with Spark_ , and throughout this book, Spark allows us to apply powerful transformations to RDDs. As DStreams are made up of RDDs, Spark Streaming provides a set of transformations available on DStreams; these transformations are similar to those available on RDDs. These include `map`, `flatMap`, `filter`, `join`, and `reduceByKey`.\n\nSpark Streaming transformations, such as those applicable to RDDs, operate on each element of a DStream's underlying data. That is, the transformations are effectively applied to each RDD in the DStream, which, in turn, applies the transformation to the elements of the RDD.\n\nSpark Streaming also provides operators such as `reduce` and `count`. These operators return a DStream made up of a single element (for example, the count value for each batch). Unlike the equivalent operators on RDDs, these do not trigger computation on DStreams directly. That is, they are not **actions** , but they are still transformations, as they return another DStream.\n\n#### Keeping track of state\n\nWhen we were dealing with batch processing of RDDs, keeping and updating a state variable was relatively straightforward. We could start with a certain state (for example, a count or sum of values) and then use broadcast variables or accumulators to update this state in parallel. Usually, we would then use an RDD action to collect the updated state to the driver and, in turn, update the global state.\n\nWith DStreams, this is a little more complex, as we need to keep track of states across batches in a fault-tolerant manner. Conveniently, Spark Streaming provides the `updateStateByKey` function on a DStream of key-value pairs, which takes care of this for us, allowing us to create a stream of arbitrary state information and update it with each batch of data seen. For example, the state could be a global count of the number of times each key has been seen. The state could, thus, represent the number of visits per web page, clicks per advert, tweets per user, or purchases per product, for example.\n\n#### General transformations\n\nThe Spark Streaming API also exposes a general `transform` function that gives us access to the underlying RDD for each batch in the stream. That is, where the higher level functions such as `map` transform a DStream to another DStream, `transform` allows us to apply functions from an RDD to another RDD. For example, we can use the RDD `join` operator to join each batch of the stream to an existing RDD that we computed separately from our streaming application (perhaps, in Spark or some other system).\n\n### Note\n\nThe full list of transformations and further information"""],
        response="Spark Streaming enables real-time data processing by leveraging its core concept of **Discretized Streams (DStreams)**, which are sequences of mini-batches of data. It processes data as it arrives rather than waiting for a complete dataset, allowing for near-instantaneous analytics. DStreams are built from input sources, and Spark Streaming can handle various data sources like files and network streams.The framework allows for operations such as transformations and actions similar to those available for RDDs, providing the ability to process each batch of data individually or apply functions to the entire stream. Additionally, Spark Streaming supports fault tolerance mechanisms, ensuring reliable processing even when failures occur by allowing batches to be recomputed as necessary.This architecture and functionality make Spark Streaming a robust tool for applications that require live data insights and action.",

        retrieved_contexts=["""use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to catch the drippings is necessary.\n\nMost beekeepers do manage to find an extractor. They are expensive, though—prices start at over $200 for a small one. You could share the cost, of course, and buy one cooperatively with one or more other beekeepers. Another possibility is to build one. This can be done without much difficulty for someone so inclined; plans for building a small extractor inexpensively do exist. Another possibility is to rent one. Many beekeeping equipment suppliers keep a rental unit on hand, so ask around.\n\nAssuming that you have located an extractor, what else do you need? Several things. First, a place to work. Extracting is messy. Even processing a small amount of honey can spread stickiness over a large area. In the early days I extracted in the kitchen. This is no problem, but be prepared for lots of cleanup. Maybe it won't be that bad for you—maybe you are a neat worker.\n\nBesides a place, you should allow plenty of time. If you decide to do it in the kitchen, don't try to sneak it in between 3 o'clock and dinner. You won't be finished in time, especially during your first attempt when you are not really sure of what you are doing. Wait until evening.\n\n### **Additional Equipment**\n\nSome additional equipment is necessary—uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, pails, honey gates, bottling tank. Let's discuss each one.\n\nTools useful for uncapping frames include (top to bottom): a kitchen carving knife, a capping scratcher, and an electric knife.\n\n**Uncapping knife.** Some kind of blade is necessary to remove the wax cappings from the comb before you can extract. The beekeeping catalogs show several uncapping knives and a plane. They are relatively expensive, even for the nonelectric versions. Consider using one of your kitchen knives the first time you extract. For one or two supers, it will be adequate. A serrated bread knife or carving knife works well, and if the blade is warmed in a pan of water periodically, it will work better.\n\nIf you are ready for something more sophisticated, your choice is between an electric knife and an electric plane. My preference is for the knife. I find the plane too heavy and awkward, but many beekeepers prefer it.\n\n**Capping scratcher.** This handy tool gets the low spots. A frame of honey, especially one newly drawn and filled, may not be drawn to a uniform depth. The uncapping knife, as it is moves across the frame, may miss some of the cappings. The scratcher can be dragged across these missed cappings to break them up.\n\n**Cappings container.** As you uncap, you will need a container, a tub or pail, to catch the cappings. They tend to flop as they fall free from the comb, so a wide container is best. A large amount of excellent honey adheres to these cappings. The container should ideally have a strainer near the bottom for the cappings to rest on and a gate or valve at the low point for removing that honey after it drains through.\n\n**Strainer.** As the honey comes from the extractor, it contains particles of wax, bits of propolis, occasional wings or legs, and other hive debris. You have a choice. You may strain it through a coarse or medium mesh of cloth or metal as it comes from the extractor. Alternatively, you can run it directly into a pail or other holding container and leave it for 24 hours or more in a warm room. At the end of that time the impurities will have risen to the top and can be skimmed off. After either coarse straining or skimming, you may wish to strain the honey through a filter cloth (70-mesh nylon, for instance) to remove any very fine particles remaining.\n\nFollowing extraction, the honey may be strained to remove coarse particles of wax, propolis, and other hive debris.\n\n**Plastic pails.** A beekeeper never seems to have enough pails. The 5-gallon size is most commonly used, with the 4-gallon running second. Larger pails are available, but honey is heavy and the larger ones can be awkward to handle. Pails can be purchased from some bee supply dealers and from other sources, but used ones are often available free or at small cost from bakeries and restaurants. Use _only_ food-quality containers—those that were manufactured to contain food and have been used exclusively for food. Food-quality pails are usually white, but being white does not guarantee their quality. Be sure to inquire about their past use.\n\n**Honey gates.** In beekeeper parlance, a gate is another name for the valve or faucet used in honey containers. Honey is a thick and viscous material. It needs a valve that shuts off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled,", ".\n\nBe careful in using and storing the fume board and the bottle of liquid. Do not store them in the house. The odor is foul, strong, and persistent. If you spill any on your clothing, you will not be welcome in polite company.\n\nA household blower commonly used for clearing fallen leaves is also effective at removing bees from the super.\n\n#### **Blower**\n\nA blower is a surprisingly effective way to remove bees from supers. It is an expense that may not be justifiable for one or two hives, though. But many households already have a suitable blower—the type used for moving leaves in a yard. Even some of the better shop vacuums may work when operated in reverse, but they require electricity, which is usually not found in the beeyard.\n\nTo use a blower, first remove the super and stand it on one end next to the hive. A stand or platform is helpful; an empty hive body works. Position the super with the bottom toward you so that the bees will be blown toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow up and down and back and forth between the frames until all or at least most of the bees are out.\n\nWhen blowing bees from the super, place the super on its end (with the bottom toward you) and blow the bees toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow between the frames.\n\nA super with lots of burr and bridge comb is difficult to clear. The bees hide behind the obstructions. Sometimes turning the super and blowing from the top does the job.\n\nNone of the methods described above is foolproof. For any of the last four, you may find that you must resort to a brush to get the last few bees out. Be prepared for this and always have a brush with you.\n\n#### **What to Do Next**\n\nYou _must_ protect the honey once you have the supers off the hive—no matter what method you use for clearing the bees. The degree and nature of the protection depends on how long it will be before you actually extract the honey from the supers. Your first concern is to put the supers under cover so the bees cannot recover their wealth. The process of removing honey from the hives has filled the air with its odor and has no doubt agitated the bees. Some of them will follow the supers and will attempt to steal it back. If you give them any kind of opportunity, they will exploit it and you may lose the crop. It is amazing how much of that honey they are able to squeeze back into the hive, even with no supers in place, once robbing gets underway. And of course, once thievery starts, you can expect other colonies in the neighborhood to join in.\n\nYour first concern, then, is to put the honey inside, preferably in a location where the bees cannot even smell it. If they know it is there—especially if the nectar flow is over—they will hang around continually, trying to get in.\n\nYour second concern is temperature and humidity. Honey flows best when it is warm; cold honey is more difficult to extract. If the honey is being taken from the hive toward the end of the season, before really cold weather sets in, you should be able to extract with little difficulty. To make your job easier, keep the supers at room temperature or higher until you actually do extract.\n\nHoney is hygroscopic: it absorbs and retains moisture. The natural environment inside a healthy hive is such that there is no moisture problem. Once off the hive though, the honey is no longer protected by the bees and may take up atmospheric moisture. High-moisture honey can ferment. Do not be overly concerned about this, however. A day or two's delay is not going to affect the moisture content appreciably. If you must store it for a longer time, though, a dehumidifier in the same room helps maintain or even lower the moisture content.\n\nBe aware that the supers will drip. The process of removing them from the hive has unavoidably broken some of the burr and bridge comb, so that honey oozes and runs out onto the floor. You will need something to catch it. A spare outer cover, inverted, makes a suitable tray.\n\nNow that the honey is off the hive and under cover, we can get on with the extraction process.\n\n### **Extracting and Handling Honey**\n\nExtracting—removing the honey from the supers—is your last big chore of the season. It is a relatively straightforward task, but it has its nuances. The best way to remove honey from the supers, and just about the only way, is to use an extractor, a piece of equipment that whirls the frames and removes the honey by centrifugal force.\n\nOne alternative to an extractor does exist, although it is not a good one: removing the honey-laden comb from the frames and crushing it, either in a mesh bag or in a large strainer. You can make a mesh bag from cheesecloth, nylon, or any other material that will hold back the broken up comb while allowing the honey to strain through. It is a messy process and takes time—24 hours or longer per load—unless you use a press of some sort to squeeze out the honey. It helps to massage the bag and its contents periodically as it drains to encourage the process.\n\nInstead of a mesh bag, you could make or acquire a strainer, such as an oversized colander. It might be necessary to use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to", 'off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled, it is ready for bottling. You can move it directly from a pail into a jar, but only with considerable difficulty and probably with lots of spillage. Because of its viscosity, honey does not pour easily. You need a means to cut off the flow sharply—a bottling tank with a honey gate should, therefore, be considered essential. You can buy a small tank, already made, or you can make one yourself. A 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail with a l¼-inch, threaded, plastic honey gate are all that are needed. Cut a hole low in the side of the pail, insert the gate, screw the nut on the back, and you\'re done. (When you cut the hole, be sure to leave room on the inside for the nut to turn.)\n\n#### **The Extracting Process**\n\nExtractors come in various sizes, measured by the number of frames they will accommodate at one time. Beginners most often use an extractor of two-, three-, or four-frame capacity. Most extractors have a reservoir below the basket where honey can accumulate as you proceed, with a honey gate to drain the reservoir. Depending on the design of the particular extractor, you may wish to keep the gate open so that honey drains through as you work. This way, it will not build up around the bottom of the basket and impede the rotation. However, this means you must have the extractor up on a platform so a pail will fit under the gate. Perhaps your extractor will have an ample reservoir at the bottom and you can allow it to sit on the floor with the gate closed, raising and draining it periodically as you proceed.\n\nThe tangential style is most common for small extractors. Frames are positioned as illustrated, with honey spun from just one side of each frame at a time.\n\nIn a radial extractor, honey is spun from both sides of the frames at once.\n\nAssume that the extractor will vibrate a bit and will try to walk about the room as you work, especially if the load is not balanced. Fasten it down somehow before you start or have a helper hold the extractor in place as you spin. Balance the load as best you can by putting frames of like weight in the same load. If you come to the end of the job without a full load of frames, use previously extracted empty frames to partially balance things.\n\nExtractors come in two styles—tangential and radial. Most of the small extractors are tangential, which means the frames are positioned at an angle to a radius of the extractor tank. This is the style you are most likely to use first. Later, if you expand your operation, you may acquire a radial extractor. In a radial extractor, the frames are positioned along a radius. The difference is that in a tangential extractor, honey is spun from only one side of each frame. In the radial type, honey is spun from both sides at once.\n\n**U SING A TANGENTIAL EXTRACTOR**\n\nTo use a tangential extractor, load up and spin out an estimated one-half of the honey from the first side. Then, remove, reverse, and replace those frames. Spin out all the honey from the second side. Reverse and replace again to finish on the first side. This is a bit of extra handling, but it helps to ensure that the weight of honey on the second side does not push through and break the somewhat tender comb of a new frame. The bees strengthen the comb a little more each year so in subsequent years the comb is not quite so fragile, but a little care in this respect will always be in order.\n\nYou have no doubt heard the expression "slower than cold molasses." Honey is the same—perhaps even slower. If you are able to store the supers in a warm room for a day or so before you extract, the honey comes from the frames much more easily and passes through your strainers more quickly.\n\nAs you process the honey, moving it from one container to another, try to minimize splashing to reduce the possibility of bubbles and foaming. Each step of the extracting, straining, and bottling process has the potential to add air to the honey. Air, of course, is not harmful, but it can be unsightly once the honey is in the jar. Also, allow the honey to sit in the bottling tank at room temperature for at least a few hours, preferably for a day or two. The bubbles rise and can be skimmed. Then bottling through a gate at the bottom should give nice clear honey in the jar.\n\nIf you have only a small quantity of honey from your extracting process, you probably will bottle it as a part of that process. However, if you have had a banner year, perhaps you will be storing some away. In that case, maybe you will choose not to bottle it now.\n\n#### **Storing Your Honey**\n\nHoney granulates. This is a fact of beekeeping life. Granulation (or crystallization) is a natural state of most honeys. It happens as a function of time and of the particular combination of sugars in the honey. Assume that any or all of your honey may granulate at some time or another. The honey is in no way damaged by this natural process and it can be returned to its liquid state with relative ease. A defense against granulation is heat. Judiciously applied, heat can stop or delay"""],
        #retrieved_contexts=['You may want to bring a garden cart or wheelbarrow up close, and perhaps the lawn mower. Be sure all of these will fit in the area you have chosen. Allow at least 3 to 4 feet on all sides of the hive, if possible.\n\nBe careful not to locate a hive on a steep slope. Level ground or a very gentle slope is probably best. A gentle slope is good because it allows cool or moist air to flow down and past the hive and not form a pool around it. If the slope is too steep, you may find covers and other hive parts also flowing down the hill when you set them on the ground. Avoid such steep slopes, as well as depressions where cool or moist air can collect.\n\n#### **Forage Availability**\n\nAn immediate question that occurs to many potential beekeepers is, "Will my chosen location support a colony of bees?" For the most part, you need not be concerned. One or two hives can be successful almost anywhere on the continent. In fact, some unlikely locales can be very successful—bees are often kept in large cities and in suburbs.\n\nThe key to this is the area around you. The normal foraging range for honey bees is 1 to 2 miles and they have been known to travel much greater distances in areas where forage was scarce. The fact that your immediate property has little to sustain the bees is not important. It is its 1-to 2-mile radius that matters. If there is a substantial amount of flowering plants in that radius, you are probably okay.\n\nOf course, if your own property does have good forage, the bees will work it and benefit from its proximity, which they will work first before traveling afield. Bees fly no farther than they must to find food.\n\nAll of this assumes, of course, that the area where you plan to locate your bees is not one already saturated by other beekeepers. If this is the case, you have a couple of choices. Find another locale, or try a hive or two and see what happens. Perhaps the neighborhood isn\'t really saturated. However, if it is, keep in mind that not only will your own bees suffer, but so will those of the other beekeepers that were there first. Consider other options before placing a hive in an area that is obviously already saturated with bees.\n\n### **Equipment and Supplies**\n\nThe array of equipment necessary for successful beekeeping is important and you should know and understand it. Standard equipment has evolved over a long period of time. It meets the needs of both the beekeeper and the bees, and for the most part, has proven its worth. Standard equipment has also evolved to provide specific sizes, dimensions, and configurations suitable to the conditions under which bees are kept in this country. None of this should be taken lightly. To repeat a general rule—stay with the tried and true as a novice. Do not experiment. Learn the basics and work with the standards. After 2 or 3 years, when you are beginning to understand bees and beekeeping, experiment if you wish. By then you will have an idea of what you are deviating from, and if things go wrong you will be able to get back on track with minimum trouble.\n\nIf you look in any beekeeping catalog you will see a myriad of equipment and supplies that can be confusing, perhaps overwhelming. However, the equipment needed for the first year and even beyond is relatively straightforward. Once you have some experience, you will come to understand the catalog offerings and can begin to pick and choose. A good rule is never to buy any piece of equipment without understanding its use and value. Don\'t get carried away by someone else\'s enthusiasm.\n\nOne of the most popular hives configurations—two full-depth, ten-frame hive bodies, with honey supers added during the active beekeeping season.\n\nIn much of this country most beekeepers use two full-depth, ten-frame hive bodies as their basic unit, with honey supers (superstructure) added and removed at appropriate times during the active beekeeping season. However, in some areas, a different configuration may be used: one full-depth body, for instance, or one full-depth and one shallow. Although the standard for most of the country is ten-frame hive bodies and supers, and that is what you will see in just about every catalog, narrower and wider boxes do exist. Eight-frame and eleven-frame units are seen occasionally. A beginner will do well to stay away from these less common sizes. Again, in starting out, stay with the standards.\n\n**B ASIC BEEKEEPING EQUIPMENT**\n\nThe following list includes everything necessary for the entire first season of keeping bees, assuming a two-story, ten-frame configuration.\n\n**Complete Two-Story Hive**\n\n• Bottom board with entrance reducer\n\n• Hive bodies (two), full-depth, 9½-inch\n\n• Frames (ten per hive body) full-depth, 9VB-inch with wedge-style top bar and two-piece or split bottom bar\n\n• Foundation—hook-wired, 8½-inch\n\n• Support pins (four per frame), or frame wire and eyelets\n\n• Inner cover—ventilated\n\n• Outer cover—telescoping\n\n**Honey Supers**\n\n• Super—shallow, 511/16-inch or mid-depth, 6⅝-inch\n\n• Frames (ten per super)—shallow, 5⅜-inch or mid-depth, 6¼\n\n• Foundation—hook-wired, shallow, 4¾-inch or mid-depth, 5⅝ inch\n\n• Support pins (four per frame), or frame wire and eyelets In the long run you will want two or three supers per hive. In the first year you may not need any.\n\n**Bees**\n\n•', "Honey Bees**\n\n**Ants** are mentioned earlier as sometimes living in a hive, but being no real problem. However, in some areas, notably the South, particular species of ants are a serious problem and must be dealt with. These ants invade bee colonies and can cause their demise. Raising the hive on legs and placing the legs in cans of oil is an often practiced defense. Alternatively, the legs can be painted with one of the available sticky substances used to trap insects. Both materials need to be watched and the sticky material especially needs to be renewed periodically. Other solutions to the ant problem may be used locally. If you have these ants, ask around.\n\n**Wax moths** can be a serious problem. However, they are rarely a problem to an otherwise healthy colony. The moths are successful only when a colony has problems that prevent it from policing the hive adequately. Although moths may enter and lay eggs in a normal healthy colony, the bees remove them or the resulting larvae. If the hive is weakened though, the moths are able to get ahead of the bees, laying eggs that successfully hatch. The resulting larvae burrow through the comb, eating impurities in the wax and leaving behind large amounts of webbing and frass. They damage the comb, destroying it completely if unchecked, and sometimes cause the death of maturing brood which become trapped in Wax moths are a particular threat to their cells and are unable to emerge as adults. The bees are largely incapable of coping with the wax moth once it has successfully become established.\n\nWax moths are a particular threat to weak bee colonies or empty equipment, where they may burrow into the comb, eat impurities in the wax, and leave behind extensive webbing and frass.\n\nOccasionally, wax moths will be found in empty supers that have been placed on a hive optimistically. If the supers are not really needed, there is no nectar flow, for instance, or the colony is too small and does not need that much storage space, wax moths may move in to the unoccupied space. In this situation, a problem exists. They can take over and become difficult or impossible for the bees to remove.\n\nThe defense against wax moths in the hive is to maintain the colony in vigorous good health through good hive management. Wax moths also invade comb in empty equipment off the hive. In fact, more damage is probably done to empty equipment in storage or to abandoned equipment than to hives occupied by bees. Care should be taken to protect such equipment during the off season. For this purpose, paradichlorobenzine (PDB), a form of moth crystals, is available. Use only PDB for such protection. Another form of moth protection commonly available, napthalene, should not be used. Residual napthalene in the comb can harm bees. PDB has no effect on bees if the comb is aired for 24 hours or so before use.\n\nTo protect unused equipment containing comb, stack the supers or hive bodies on a solid, even surface that will prevent rodents from entering at the bottom. Counting up from the bottom of the stack, place a sheet of paper about 6 to 8 inches square on the top bars of the frames of every third or fourth super. Deposit about ⅓ cup of PDB crystals on each piece of paper. Cover the top of the stack. A spare outer cover is ideal, but anything to keep out rodents will do. Over time the PDB crystals will vaporize. The vapors, being heavier than air, will settle through the stack. For long-term storage, the PDB may need to be renewed periodically.\n\nBecause wax moths are killed by freezing temperatures, they are less of a problem in the more northern parts of the country. But protect against them wherever you live.\n\nMice find a beehive to be a wonderful place to spend the winter and they can cause a great deal of damage. You should assume that a mouse will find your hive at some time or another, so be prepared. Keep them out.\n\nThe mouse enters on cool nights in the fall when the bees are clustered. It chews a hole several inches in diameter and builds a spherical nest through several frames of comb. The nest is made of materials the mouse brings in—grass, leaves, and other typical mouse nest material. The mouse apparently builds this nest at a time when it is too cold for the bees to break their cluster. Once complete, the mouse can stop up its entrance to keep bees out if the weather warms up.\n\nIn the worst case situation, a mouse can create enough disruption to cause the colony to abscond. Occasionally, the bees are able to attack the mouse and kill it. Since they cannot move it, they then may embalm it with propolis.\n\nThe best defense against mice is a metal guard over the entrance. Mice can chew through a wooden entrance reducer or most other wooden barriers. A strip cut from %-inch wire mesh will serve, or obtain one of the metal guards made for the purpose.\n\nDon't delay in placing that mouse guard in the fall. Late summer may even be better—mice get ready for winter early.\n\nSkunks enjoy a meal of adult bees, which they catch alive at the hive entrance. They are seemingly impervious to bee stings and at times are a serious pest of beehives. Over a period of days, a skunk can severely weaken a colony.\n\nThe skunk approaches the hive entrance at night, scratches on the landing board, and catches individual bees as they come out to investigate. Each bee is caught in the skunk's paw, rolled on the ground and killed, and then popped into the skunk's mouth.\n\nThere are several kinds of evidence of a skunk's depredations. One sign is the holes it digs around the yard as it feeds on grubs in your lawn. Then, just in front of the", "We will be able to continue keeping bees successfully only after all beekeepers come to understand the state of beekeeping today, and accept their responsibilities.\n\n#### **Regulations about Bees**\n\nNo federal laws exist in this country that regulate beekeeping, except the one that bans the importation of live bees. The parasitic mites mentioned above are not native to the Western Hemisphere and have been in North America only since the mid-1980s. We do not know specifically how they came into this country, but they were probably brought in illegally with queen bees—a violation of this federal ban.\n\nLaws or regulations governing bees do exist at the state level and vary from state to state. Some states totally ban importation of live bees. Others allow importation, but only when specific conditions are met (for instance, a certificate of inspection from the originating state showing that the bees were inspected within a certain recent period and are free of disease and mites). As the Africanized bee spreads, further regulation is probable. Some moves have been made toward more uniform regulations from state to state, but little progress has been made.\n\nIt is the responsibility of each individual beekeeper to be aware of the specific laws and regulations of the state(s) in which he or she keeps bees and to follow these laws and regulations faithfully. Too much is at stake to allow anyone to go his or her own way. Mites, undetected or untreated, can wipe out a beekeeper's holdings. Seemingly unprovoked stinging attacks, as from Africanized bees or from any bees that the public may perceive to be Africanized, can result in a total ban of bees from specified areas. Unfortunately, the public and the representatives of many official agencies who should be better informed, do not understand the scope and importance of honeybees to our way of life. Perhaps we will someday have alternatives, but for now we cannot do without honey bees. It is not an exaggeration to say that our present diet, a large part of our environment, and, in turn, our way of life is dependent on the pollination services of honeybees.\n\nYour mentor, if you have one, your local beekeeping organization, or your local equipment supplier should be able to help you find out about the laws and regulations in your state and municipality. Other sources include your state's department of agriculture and the cooperative extension system.\n\n### **History of Beekeeping**\n\nThe history of beekeeping may sound like a rather dull topic to someone who is anxious to get some bees and begin. However, certain of our practices, techniques, and current attitudes result from or are carried over from the earlier days of beekeeping. It is thus helpful to know at least a smattering of the history of the craft.\n\nBees have been kept, or at least exploited, as far back as we have records. Primitive people robbed bees of their honey, as is evidenced by ancient cave paintings. Stone-Age people probably kept bees in some manner and can be considered the first beekeepers. After that early period, we can identify at least three eras of beekeeping: the first, from ancient times until about 1500; the second, from about 1500 until 1850; and the third, from 1850 until the present. Perhaps we are now actually in a fourth era, one marked by extensive research and resultant discoveries, by the ever-increasing role of bees as pollinators of commercial crops, by the pressures of human growth and population, and by the problems of the day—mites and Africanized bees.\n\nOne of the earliest hives was made from a section of naturally hollow log. Such hives could still be found in use this century.\n\n#### **The First Era**\n\nDuring the first era, pre-1500, beekeeping was more properly beehaving; that is, people had, rather than kept, bees. The term still has application today. In those early days, bees were exploited more than kept. Honey was, no doubt, simply collected from a hollow tree or whatever other space the bees had found to build their nest. When bees were kept in containers provided by the beekeeper, these early hives were small, probably by necessity, because in early times tools were limited and large containers hard to come by. Furthermore, because of the beekeeper's limited knowledge of bees and colony management, swarming was encouraged. Collecting swarms was the only method available to increase holdings and to replace winter losses. Small containers would also encourage swarming. Hives were made of whatever was available to the particular culture—pottery, woven material, mud and wattle, or a section of hollow log. Later, the more advanced societies employed skeps (domed hives made of twisted straw).\n\nThe skep was an immediate precursor of our modern wooden hives.\n\nAll of these early hives were crude, at least by our standards. Access was from the bottom or end. No one had worked out a method for removing the comb. The only means known to remove the honey was to cut out and crush the comb. The result was that the colony probably died, either immediately, or later for lack of food.\n\nThe philosophy of early beekeeping was simple: have many hives, swarms are good, kill off the good honey producers in the fall in order to take their honey, start over in the spring, encourage those overwintered hives (the weak ones) to swarm. The result—breed to a weakness, breed to swarm.\n\nVery little was known about the bees themselves during this early era, and what was known tended to be localized. The Romans developed some knowledge. They fed the bees in times of need and began to wonder about them, but they had little or no understanding of what went on in the hive. This was at least in part because it was difficult to observe life in a", "use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to catch the drippings is necessary.\n\nMost beekeepers do manage to find an extractor. They are expensive, though—prices start at over $200 for a small one. You could share the cost, of course, and buy one cooperatively with one or more other beekeepers. Another possibility is to build one. This can be done without much difficulty for someone so inclined; plans for building a small extractor inexpensively do exist. Another possibility is to rent one. Many beekeeping equipment suppliers keep a rental unit on hand, so ask around.\n\nAssuming that you have located an extractor, what else do you need? Several things. First, a place to work. Extracting is messy. Even processing a small amount of honey can spread stickiness over a large area. In the early days I extracted in the kitchen. This is no problem, but be prepared for lots of cleanup. Maybe it won't be that bad for you—maybe you are a neat worker.\n\nBesides a place, you should allow plenty of time. If you decide to do it in the kitchen, don't try to sneak it in between 3 o'clock and dinner. You won't be finished in time, especially during your first attempt when you are not really sure of what you are doing. Wait until evening.\n\n### **Additional Equipment**\n\nSome additional equipment is necessary—uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, pails, honey gates, bottling tank. Let's discuss each one.\n\nTools useful for uncapping frames include (top to bottom): a kitchen carving knife, a capping scratcher, and an electric knife.\n\n**Uncapping knife.** Some kind of blade is necessary to remove the wax cappings from the comb before you can extract. The beekeeping catalogs show several uncapping knives and a plane. They are relatively expensive, even for the nonelectric versions. Consider using one of your kitchen knives the first time you extract. For one or two supers, it will be adequate. A serrated bread knife or carving knife works well, and if the blade is warmed in a pan of water periodically, it will work better.\n\nIf you are ready for something more sophisticated, your choice is between an electric knife and an electric plane. My preference is for the knife. I find the plane too heavy and awkward, but many beekeepers prefer it.\n\n**Capping scratcher.** This handy tool gets the low spots. A frame of honey, especially one newly drawn and filled, may not be drawn to a uniform depth. The uncapping knife, as it is moves across the frame, may miss some of the cappings. The scratcher can be dragged across these missed cappings to break them up.\n\n**Cappings container.** As you uncap, you will need a container, a tub or pail, to catch the cappings. They tend to flop as they fall free from the comb, so a wide container is best. A large amount of excellent honey adheres to these cappings. The container should ideally have a strainer near the bottom for the cappings to rest on and a gate or valve at the low point for removing that honey after it drains through.\n\n**Strainer.** As the honey comes from the extractor, it contains particles of wax, bits of propolis, occasional wings or legs, and other hive debris. You have a choice. You may strain it through a coarse or medium mesh of cloth or metal as it comes from the extractor. Alternatively, you can run it directly into a pail or other holding container and leave it for 24 hours or more in a warm room. At the end of that time the impurities will have risen to the top and can be skimmed off. After either coarse straining or skimming, you may wish to strain the honey through a filter cloth (70-mesh nylon, for instance) to remove any very fine particles remaining.\n\nFollowing extraction, the honey may be strained to remove coarse particles of wax, propolis, and other hive debris.\n\n**Plastic pails.** A beekeeper never seems to have enough pails. The 5-gallon size is most commonly used, with the 4-gallon running second. Larger pails are available, but honey is heavy and the larger ones can be awkward to handle. Pails can be purchased from some bee supply dealers and from other sources, but used ones are often available free or at small cost from bakeries and restaurants. Use _only_ food-quality containers—those that were manufactured to contain food and have been used exclusively for food. Food-quality pails are usually white, but being white does not guarantee their quality. Be sure to inquire about their past use.\n\n**Honey gates.** In beekeeper parlance, a gate is another name for the valve or faucet used in honey containers. Honey is a thick and viscous material. It needs a valve that shuts off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled,", "careful with the comb in doing so; it is not as strong as wired extracting comb. Next year, give these frames back as extracting comb. The bees will strengthen it with wax and propolis and in 2 or 3 years you may have difficulty distinguishing it from regular wired comb.\n\nCut comb honey can be conveniently packed in square plastic boxes, available from bee equipment suppliers.\n\nIf all went well and you do have some acceptable comb honey, cut it carefully from the frames with a warm knife. Some cells will be cut open in the process and, as a result, honey will run. Allow the sections to drain on a wire rack over a shallow pan for a few hours in a warm room, then pack it in boxes. Draining is not absolutely required; it is primarily for appearance. Otherwise the comb section would sit in the box in an unsightly puddle.\n\nUse square plastic boxes, available from bee equipment suppliers, to pack comb honey. A shallow frame, completely filled, will yield four equal sections of comb that fit these boxes perfectly. If the frames are not completely filled, cut out the best parts and put the scraps in a bowl. Leave it out to snack on—it's delicious.\n\nThe question often arises about how to use comb honey. It is often eaten directly, by the spoonful, as a substitute for candy. The wax is edible. It can be chewed up and swallowed or treated like gum—once the goodness is chewed out, dispose of it. Comb honey can also be spread on toast or muffins, wax and all.\n\nIf you have only a modest number of sections, your family will use them quickly. Otherwise, they make wonderful gifts. And a gift of comb honey is a good way to introduce people to one of the pleasures of beekeeping, especially those neighbors who may be a little apprehensive about your bees.\n\nFor long-term storage, place the sections of comb in a plastic bag in the freezer so they do not granulate. However, even granulated, it is good to eat.\n\n### **Other Hive Products**\n\nDuring your first year or two as a beekeeper, you should not be overly concerned with other hive products, but be aware of them. They are of interest to many people and you will probably be questioned. The five other products of the hive that are frequently discussed (and sometimes collected) are beeswax, pollen, propolis, royal jelly, and venom. Two of these have further uses by beekeepers, but other uses exist for all five, primarily as natural food or health supplements. The efficacy of some of these health uses is not conclusive.\n\n#### **Beeswax**\n\nBeeswax has a variety of uses. A very large quantity is recycled to become the beeswax foundation we use in our hives. It is commonly used in candles, either pure or mixed with paraffin; it is often an ingredient in certain types of cosmetics, creams, and salves; and it is sometimes a component in wood and metal polishes.\n\n**A PITHERAPY**\n\nApitherapy, sometimes written apiotherapy, is the collective term used to cover any aspect of health treatment involving products of the hive. As such, it covers all the products discussed here, including honey. This is a growing field of interest and study, and though much of the medical community does not agree, it is a field that holds promise. At least one organization exists in the United States to further this work—the American Apitherapy Society, P.O. Box 74, North Hartland, VT 05052.\n\nOver time, a beekeeper tends to accumulate significant quantities of wax, which come from three basic sources: cappings from the honey extracting process, scrapings of burr and bridge comb from working the hive, and melted down older comb. As a new beekeeper, you are not likely to have much, if any, of the latter. Presumably, your comb is new and will remain in good condition for at least 3 or 4 years. After that you will start to recycle some of the comb as it ages and deteriorates.\n\nCappings and scrapings, when melted down and cleaned, usually yield high-quality, light-colored wax. This should be kept separate from melted-down brood comb, which is almost certainly dark and contains impurities not easily removed by the beekeeper. The lighter waxes command premium prices when sold and are the only acceptable wax for use in candles and salves, for instance. The darker waxes can be treated in industrial processes to bleach their color, but this is not something a small operator can easily do.\n\n#### **Pollen**\n\nPollen is often collected at the hive by beekeepers and fed back to the bees in times of need, or sold as a health food supplement. Special pollen-trapping apparatus is available from bee supply sources. During its first season, a colony should not be subjected to the stresses of pollen trapping. Later, you may choose to do so, but it is a subject to be researched carefully first.\n\nPollen is often touted as a perfect food for humans because it is said to contain all of the vitamins and the minerals necessary for human health. Users frequently extol its benefits. No one seriously questions whether pollen does in fact contain these vitamins and minerals. There is a question, however, as to whether the human body is capable of breaking down pollen and using it.\n\nA further concern is that we are often not aware of the source of pollen offered for sale. There is no convenient way to know if the pollen was collected from plants recently treated with pesticides. This can be a concern even with your own bees. You are never sure where they have been foraging.\n\n#### **Propolis**\n\nPropolis is a resinous substance collected by the bees from the bark and buds of trees and other plant materials. It is used in the hive to seal up cracks and crevices, making the hive", ".\n\nBe careful in using and storing the fume board and the bottle of liquid. Do not store them in the house. The odor is foul, strong, and persistent. If you spill any on your clothing, you will not be welcome in polite company.\n\nA household blower commonly used for clearing fallen leaves is also effective at removing bees from the super.\n\n#### **Blower**\n\nA blower is a surprisingly effective way to remove bees from supers. It is an expense that may not be justifiable for one or two hives, though. But many households already have a suitable blower—the type used for moving leaves in a yard. Even some of the better shop vacuums may work when operated in reverse, but they require electricity, which is usually not found in the beeyard.\n\nTo use a blower, first remove the super and stand it on one end next to the hive. A stand or platform is helpful; an empty hive body works. Position the super with the bottom toward you so that the bees will be blown toward the front of the hive. Direct the air flow up and down and back and forth between the frames until all or at least most of the bees are out.\n\nWhen blowing bees from the super, place the super on its end (with the bottom toward you) and blow the bees toward the front of the hive.

Be prepared for this and always have a brush with you.\n\n#### **What to Do Next**\n\nYou _must_ protect the honey once you have the supers off the hive—no matter what method you use for clearing the bees. The degree and nature of the protection depends on how long it will be before you actually extract the honey from the supers. Your first concern is to put the supers under cover so the bees cannot recover their wealth. The process of removing honey from the hives has filled the air with its odor and has no doubt agitated the bees. Some of them will follow the supers and will attempt to steal it back. If you give them any kind of opportunity, they will exploit it and you may lose the crop. It is amazing how much of that honey they are able to squeeze back into the hive, even with no supers in place, once robbing gets underway. And of course, once thievery starts, you can expect other colonies in the neighborhood to join in.\n\nYour first concern, then, is to put the honey inside, preferably in a location where the bees cannot even smell it. If they know it is there—especially if the nectar flow is over—they will hang around continually, trying to get in.\n\nYour second concern is temperature and humidity. Honey flows best when it is warm; cold honey is more difficult to extract. If the honey is being taken from the hive toward the end of the season, before really cold weather sets in, you should be able to extract with little difficulty. To make your job easier, keep the supers at room temperature or higher until you actually do extract.\n\nHoney is hygroscopic: it absorbs and retains moisture. The natural environment inside a healthy hive is such that there is no moisture problem. Once off the hive though, the honey is no longer protected by the bees and may take up atmospheric moisture. High-moisture honey can ferment. Do not be overly concerned about this, however. A day or two's delay is not going to affect the moisture content appreciably. If you must store it for a longer time, though, a dehumidifier in the same room helps maintain or even lower the moisture content.\n\nBe aware that the supers will drip. The process of removing them from the hive has unavoidably broken some of the burr and bridge comb, so that honey oozes and runs out onto the floor. You will need something to catch it. A spare outer cover, inverted, makes a suitable tray.\n\nNow that the honey is off the hive and under cover, we can get on with the extraction process.\n\n### **Extracting and Handling Honey**\n\nExtracting—removing the honey from the supers—is your last big chore of the season. It is a relatively straightforward task, but it has its nuances. The best way to remove honey from the supers, and just about the only way, is to use an extractor, a piece of equipment that whirls the frames and removes the honey by centrifugal force.\n\nOne alternative to an extractor does exist, although it is not a good one: removing the honey-laden comb from the frames and crushing it, either in a mesh bag or in a large strainer. You can make a mesh bag from cheesecloth, nylon, or any other material that will hold back the broken up comb while allowing the honey to strain through. It is a messy process and takes time—24 hours or longer per load—unless you use a press of some sort to squeeze out the honey. It helps to massage the bag and its contents periodically as it drains to encourage the process.\n\nInstead of a mesh bag, you could make or acquire a strainer, such as an oversized colander. It might be necessary to use the mesh material in conjunction with this if the holes in the strainer are large. Otherwise, the honey will be full of particles of wax and other debris.\n\nA big disadvantage of the crushing method, aside from the messiness of the process, is that the comb is destroyed. The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved.

The bees must start off with new foundation in the following season. Furthermore, it is not a practical method when any significant amount of honey is involved. Whichever method you use, a pot or a pail to catch the drippings is necessary.\n\nMost beekeepers do manage to find an extractor. They are expensive, though—prices start at over $200 for a small one. You could share the cost, of course, and buy one cooperatively with one or more other beekeepers. Another possibility is to build one. This can be done without much difficulty for someone so inclined; plans for building a small extractor inexpensively do exist. Another possibility is to rent one. Many beekeeping equipment suppliers keep a rental unit on hand, so ask around.\n\nAssuming that you have located an extractor, what else do you need? Several things. First, a place to work. Extracting is messy. Even processing a small amount of honey can spread stickiness over a large area. In the early days I extracted in the kitchen. This is no problem, but be prepared for lots of cleanup. Maybe it won't be that bad for you—maybe you are a neat worker.\n\nBesides a place, you should allow plenty of time. If you decide to do it in the kitchen, don't try to sneak it in between 3 o'clock and dinner. You won't be finished in time, especially during your first attempt when you are not really sure of what you are doing. Wait until evening.\n\n### **Additional Equipment**\n\nSome additional equipment is necessary—uncapping knife, capping scratcher, cappings container, strainer, pails, honey gates, bottling tank. Let's discuss each one.\n\nTools useful for uncapping frames include (top to bottom): a kitchen carving knife, a capping scratcher, and an electric knife.\n\n**Uncapping knife.** Some kind of blade is necessary to remove the wax cappings from the comb before you can extract. The beekeeping catalogs show several uncapping knives and a plane. They are relatively expensive, even for the nonelectric versions. Consider using one of your kitchen knives the first time you extract. For one or two supers, it will be adequate. A serrated bread knife or carving knife works well, and if the blade is warmed in a pan of water periodically, it will work better.\n\nIf you are ready for something more sophisticated, your choice is between an electric knife and an electric plane. My preference is for the knife. I find the plane too heavy and awkward, but many beekeepers prefer it.\n\n**Capping scratcher.** This handy tool gets the low spots. A frame of honey, especially one newly drawn and filled, may not be drawn to a uniform depth. The uncapping knife, as it is moves across the frame, may miss some of the cappings. The scratcher can be dragged across these missed cappings to break them up.\n\n**Cappings container.** As you uncap, you will need a container, a tub or pail, to catch the cappings. They tend to flop as they fall free from the comb, so a wide container is best. A large amount of excellent honey adheres to these cappings. The container should ideally have a strainer near the bottom for the cappings to rest on and a gate or valve at the low point for removing that honey after it drains through.\n\n**Strainer.** As the honey comes from the extractor, it contains particles of wax, bits of propolis, occasional wings or legs, and other hive debris. You have a choice. You may strain it through a coarse or medium mesh of cloth or metal as it comes from the extractor. Alternatively, you can run it directly into a pail or other holding container and leave it for 24 hours or more in a warm room. At the end of that time the impurities will have risen to the top and can be skimmed off. After either coarse straining or skimming, you may wish to strain the honey through a filter cloth (70-mesh nylon, for instance) to remove any very fine particles remaining.\n\nFollowing extraction, the honey may be strained to remove coarse particles of wax, propolis, and other hive debris.\n\n**Plastic pails.** A beekeeper never seems to have enough pails. The 5-gallon size is most commonly used, with the 4-gallon running second. Larger pails are available, but honey is heavy and the larger ones can be awkward to handle. Pails can be purchased from some bee supply dealers and from other sources, but used ones are often available free or at small cost from bakeries and restaurants. Use _only_ food-quality containers—those that were manufactured to contain food and have been used exclusively for food. Food-quality pails are usually white, but being white does not guarantee their quality. Be sure to inquire about their past use.\n\n**Honey gates.** In beekeeper parlance, a gate is another name for the valve or faucet used in honey containers. Honey is a thick and viscous material. It needs a valve that shuts off the flow quickly and cleanly with a minimum of dripping. Honey gates do this. Gates are available in two materials, plastic and brass. Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled,", ".\n\nBe careful in using and storing the fume board and the bottle of liquid. Do not store them in the house. The odor is foul, strong, and persistent. If you spill any on your clothing, you will not be welcome in polite company.\n\nA household blower commonly used for clearing fallen leaves is also effective at removing bees from the super.\n\n#### **Blower**\n\nA blower is a surprisingly effective way to remove bees from supers. It is an expense that may not be justifiable for one or two hives, though. But many households already have a suitable blower—the type used for moving leaves in a yard. Even some of the better shop vacuums may work when operated in reverse, but they require electricity, which is usually not found in the beeyard.\n\nTo use a blower, first remove the super and stand it on one end next to the hive.

Brass is normally used for the larger heavy-duty applications. For most small operations, plastic serves well.\n\nYou can make your own honey bottling tank with a 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail and a threaded, plastic honey gate.\n\n**Bottling tank.** Once you have your honey out of the extractor, strained, and settled, it is ready for bottling. You can move it directly from a pail into a jar, but only with considerable difficulty and probably with lots of spillage. Because of its viscosity, honey does not pour easily. You need a means to cut off the flow sharply—a bottling tank with a honey gate should, therefore, be considered essential. You can buy a small tank, already made, or you can make one yourself. A 5-or 6-gallon plastic pail with a l¼-inch, threaded, plastic honey gate are all that are needed. Cut a hole low in the side of the pail, insert the gate, screw the nut on the back, and you\'re done. (When you cut the hole, be sure to leave room on the inside for the nut to turn.)\n\n#### **The Extracting Process**\n\nExtractors come in various sizes, measured by the number of frames they will accommodate at one time. Beginners most often use an extractor of two-, three-, or four-frame capacity. Most extractors have a reservoir below the basket where honey can accumulate as you proceed, with a honey gate to drain the reservoir. Depending on the design of the particular extractor, you may wish to keep the gate open so that honey drains through as you work. This way, it will not build up around the bottom of the basket and impede the rotation. However, this means you must have the extractor up on a platform so a pail will fit under the gate. Perhaps your extractor will have an ample reservoir at the bottom and you can allow it to sit on the floor with the gate closed, raising and draining it periodically as you proceed.\n\nThe tangential style is most common for small extractors. Frames are positioned as illustrated, with honey spun from just one side of each frame at a time.\n\nIn a radial extractor, honey is spun from both sides of the frames at once.\n\nAssume that the extractor will vibrate a bit and will try to walk about the room as you work, especially if the load is not balanced. Fasten it down somehow before you start or have a helper hold the extractor in place as you spin. Balance the load as best you can by putting frames of like weight in the same load. If you come to the end of the job without a full load of frames, use previously extracted empty frames to partially balance things.\n\nExtractors come in two styles—tangential and radial. Most of the small extractors are tangential, which means the frames are positioned at an angle to a radius of the extractor tank. This is the style you are most likely to use first. Later, if you expand your operation, you may acquire a radial extractor. In a radial extractor, the frames are positioned along a radius. The difference is that in a tangential extractor, honey is spun from only one side of each frame. In the radial type, honey is spun from both sides at once.\n\n**U SING A TANGENTIAL EXTRACTOR**\n\nTo use a tangential extractor, load up and spin out an estimated one-half of the honey from the first side. Then, remove, reverse, and replace those frames. Spin out all the honey from the second side. Reverse and replace again to finish on the first side. This is a bit of extra handling, but it helps to ensure that the weight of honey on the second side does not push through and break the somewhat tender comb of a new frame. The bees strengthen the comb a little more each year so in subsequent years the comb is not quite so fragile, but a little care in this respect will always be in order.\n\nYou have no doubt heard the expression "slower than cold molasses." Honey is the same—perhaps even slower. If you are able to store the supers in a warm room for a day or so before you extract, the honey comes from the frames much more easily and passes through your strainers more quickly.\n\nAs you process the honey, moving it from one container to another, try to minimize splashing to reduce the possibility of bubbles and foaming. Each step of the extracting, straining, and bottling process has the potential to add air to the honey. Air, of course, is not harmful, but it can be unsightly once the honey is in the jar. Also, allow the honey to sit in the bottling tank at room temperature for at least a few hours, preferably for a day or two. The bubbles rise and can be skimmed. Then bottling through a gate at the bottom should give nice clear honey in the jar.\n\nIf you have only a small quantity of honey from your extracting process, you probably will bottle it as a part of that process. However, if you have had a banner year, perhaps you will be storing some away. In that case, maybe you will choose not to bottle it now.\n\n#### **Storing Your Honey**\n\nHoney granulates. This is a fact of beekeeping life. Granulation (or crystallization) is a natural state of most honeys. It happens as a function of time and of the particular combination of sugars in the honey. Assume that any or all of your honey may granulate at some time or another. The honey is in no way damaged by this natural process and it can be returned to its liquid state with relative ease. A defense against granulation is heat. Judiciously applied, heat can stop or delay'],
